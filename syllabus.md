# Introduction to Digital Research
Fall 2021 (August 16 - December 6) Mondays, 6:00pm - 8:45pm

**Instructor**: Hillary Richardson, Assoc. Prof/Coordinator of Undergraduate Research and Information Literacy
**Contact me**: hhrichardson@muw.edu or 662-329-7334
**Office Hours**: Fant Memorial Library, by appointment (email or schedule at https://libreserves.muw.edu/

## Class Description:

This class is not unlike a traditional introduction to research class. We will plan a research project, write research questions, and analyze data to probe and discuss questions of interest to us and the larger world of academia. What sets this class apart is we will be learning how to apply that traditional practice to digital objects, going beyond making websites and scanning documents to visualizing analyses in online platforms and documenting our progress along the way. This class will make visible the “invisible labor” of digital scholarship, will teach you persistence and flexibility with technology, will give you practice collaborating on several mini hands-on projects, and it will give you a cool project and some technical skills to put on your résumé.

## Course Objectives:
* Define, digitize, assemble, and create metadata for a circumscribed dataset
* Design several small research projects that experiment with various digital tools and methods, creating a strategy for the project and documenting progress toward defined goals
* Demystify underpinnings of digital research projects, such as algorithms, formulas, and metadata
* Become familiar with various ethical, sociocultural, and technological issues associated with digital research and publishing.
* Synthesize the process of a digital project into a reflective paper that pinpoints the goals of the project, the challenges faced, and strategies used to complete those goals.

## Assignments

| Assignment | % of Grade |

## Course expectations:
 * __Readings/Lessons__: it’s important to keep up with course reading and video material, as you will be discussing them with your classmates and in your reading responses each week. They will provide a valuable theoretical and practical framework as you begin to work with digital studies tools.
 * __Creativity__: there's a lot of room for curiosity and creativity in digital studies, and there is no one "right" answer. This course is a place to explore connections between content and technology.
 * __Failure__: You will be working with content and technology that is unfamiliar to you, and at times you may struggle with analysis tools or your research material. Often the most valuable learning happens during this time! I will score your work in this course primarily on *process* rather than on the final product. Showing us something that doesn't work quite like you want/expect, and explaining your steps and what your goal is, indicates a level of engagement and curiosity we are all striving towards.
 * __Respect__: You'll be interacting with your classmates in person and in the online environment, on the discussion board in posts and replies, and in the zoom classroom. The expectation is that interactions will be respectful, kind and constructive at all times.
 * __Communication__: I expect to hear from you if something is going well, or less than well, at any point in the course. You can expect me to provide feedback on submitted work in a timely manner (within two weeks of submission). I am available to talk via Zoom/phone throughout the week, including weekends outside of class, so feel free to make an appointment to chat about course content, processes, concerns etc.
 * __Precarity__: Any student facing housing, food, or health challenges which they believe will affect their performance in this course is urged to contact me or the Student Emergency Fund for support and accommodation. One of the best 
strategies you can have is to tackle issues before they become a crisis: it's OK to ask for assistance!

## University Policies
* __Attendance__: Unless otherwise noted in the syllabus schedule, attendance is required. With the exception of readings and discussion posts, the majority of the work for the course will be done in class, and in a group setting, so it is important to be present and alert for class. That said, absences are bound to happen, so you may accrue 3 absences (excused or unexcused) without penalty. Excused absences, as listed in the undergraduate bulletin, will require documentation, and students are responsible for making up missed work as a result of any absence. Students missing more than 50% of meetings will not receive credit.
* __Title IX__: Mississippi University for Women recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people.  The University is committed to creating an educational and learning environment that is free from discrimination based on sex, including sexual violence (assault, domestic violence, dating violence and gender-based stalking).  To learn more about the University's policy on sexual misconduct, how to make a report, or confidential resources, go to www.muw.edu/titleix.  The Title IX Coordinator is located in Cochran Hall, Room 405, and may be contacted by phone at 662-241-6083 or email at titleix@muw.edu.
* __Americans with Disabilities Act__: The University is committed to providing equitable access to learning for all students.  The Student Success Center is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities (e.g. physical, sensory, chronic health, learning, attentional, mental health) and arranges for reasonable accommodations to be implemented.  It is the responsibility of students requesting accommodations to make an appointment with the Student Support Specialist to review specific needs, participate in the development of an Accommodation Plan by providing appropriate documentation, and discuss with the instructor how the Accommodation Plan will be applied in the course.  Accommodations are not retroactive and a new Accommodation Plan must be reviewed, signed and presented to instructors each semester. The Student Support Specialist is located in Reneau Hall, Room 101(B), and may be contacted by phone at 662.329.7138 or email at ada@muw.edu.
* __Academic Integrity__: All Mississippi University for Women students are expected to engage honestly and responsibly in their academic work and to refrain from any dishonest academic behavior. Violations of Academic Integrity include cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, falsification, or other actions that violate commonly accepted intellectual and ethical standards within academic and scientific communities. Violations of Academic Integrity can lead to severe penalties, from a zero grade for a test or assignment to expulsion from the University. Academic Integrity applies to work in progress as well as completed work. If you are uncertain about the proper procedure to follow when citing a source, working in a team with other students, or any other coursework situation please ask your instructor, a librarian, or a resource like the Writing Center for help. To learn more about the university’s standards of Academic Integrity, including what happens if your instructor believes that you have engaged in dishonest academic behavior and your rights to appeal such a charge, please consult section 7.2 of the Undergraduate Bulletin.
