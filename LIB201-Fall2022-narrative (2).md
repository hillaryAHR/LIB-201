# Life Through Letters
This project takes a look at life in Mississippi in the early part of th twentieth century by looking at what people wrote in their letters, which were the primary form of communication at the time.  In particular, we will look at the Smith family, whose letters have been donated to the Mississippi University for Women.

In this narrative, we are specifically looking at:
1. [The network of correspondence](##network-of-correspondemnce), which shows us the links between people writing letters to each other, 
2. [Victory Mail during World War II](##correspondence-during-wwii), or the progression of "v-mail," and how it was considered a civic duty to write letters to soldiers, and
3. [How people wrote about religion in letters to each other](##writing-about-religion), and whether or not these letters speak to how they felt about church

## About the Project
<!-- describe the letter collection-->
The Murphree-Ellard-Pilgreen-Smith collection is a collection of objects, including letters, belonging to the Mississippi University for Women, that were created by members of the Smith family.  This project is located at [Athena Commons](https://athenacommons.muw.edu/smithpapers/) at the MUW website.

This project was created by Amanda Shinn and Hillary H. Richardson.  Amanda Shinn is a student at the MUW, class of 2023, majoring in Public History.  She is the writer, lead researcher, and lead curator of this project.  Hillary Richardson is the instructor of LIB 201, and the coordinator of undergraduate research at MUW.

## Network of Correspondence
1. Screenshots of Palladio
2.  Explanation
The nodes represent individuals who are writing and recieving letters and the lines represent the connections between them and the people that they are writing letters to or recieving letters from.  These screenshots tell us that Edith Pauline Smith, "Pauline", the mother of the family,  was the person with the highest number of connections to other people.  
The people with the most "betweenness" or the most connections to nodes not connected to other people are her daughters Edith Christine Faust, "Christine", and Martha Josephine Womble, "Martha", both of whom had very active social lives, as revealed by reading the letters they wrote.  Her other daughter, Annie Bernice Smith, "Bernice", has a relatively small node and is the only family member with no direct connection to her father.  
The father of the family, Pauline's husband, Sam Hawkins Smith, "Daddy", was a U.S. senator and had connections to other senators from Mississippi, as is shown in the image above.

2. Explanation of what the timeline includes
This timeline is about the history of v-mail from its creation in 1942 to its discontinuation in 1945.  V-mail made delivering mail to soldiers faster.  Sending mail to soldiers was considered a patriotic duty, because it improved morale.

## Writing about Religion
1. Explanation of mini-project (include research questions, datasets, text analysis tools, and cleaning methods)
For this mini-project, I wanted to know if I could find out anything about religion from analyzing Smith Papers Letters that inclded the words church, S. School, and preacher and running a sentiment analysis and a topic modeling anakysis.  There were 65 letters in all.  I cleaned it by removing the words used in the letterhead from the stop word list.  I also removed & and -.  The sentiment analysis showed me that most of the letters were either nuetral or slightly positive.  The topic modeling analysis came up with topics that did not make much sense.
