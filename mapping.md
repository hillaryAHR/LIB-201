# Mapping Spatial and Temporal data
Why make a map or a timeline? What's the point? What kinds of questions do these answer?

Think of the data we've already gathered in the Smith letters. Which data allow themselves to tell a geographical or temporal story?  How can we supplement those data with contextual information that we can incorporate into the already established data?

## Objectives
- Understand what geospatial data is, how it is organized, and what it could include.
- Identify and manage files, including, but not limited to the Smith Papers Collection, for creating a timeline or mapping visualization
- Address a research question using an original map or timeline
- Identify further resources ( primary and/or secondary sources) as context to support a spatial or temporal analysis

## Lessons
1. Primary and Secondary Source Research
2. Timelines
3. Geospatial Data

## Ethical considerations
Many maps, especially digital mapping projects, use a 2-dimensional representation (i.e. flat) of the earth, which is just a part of the inaccuracies of our world that maps represent. Like historical records, maps (and even timelines!) are incomplete choices that represent human experience of the world. As you create maps and/or timelines, consider these questions, adapted from <a href="https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/mapping/lessons/?page=4">DH Institutes Curriculum</a>, that critically examine the process of map-making:
* <b>How are you collecting data?</b> Are you gathering data, or using existing data? What are the limitations of either, and what choices lead to this decision (convenience? access? most appropriate?)
* <b>What is missing from your data?</b> If you collect population information, which populations are you including/excluding? What boundaries (county? state? neighborhood?) define the map?
* <b>What symbols represent data?</b> Be aware of the colors and symbols you use to represent information. These choices can affect how others interpret your map! 
* <b>Are you using images in your media?</b> If you use images to supplement your data, be sure they are either public domain or licensed for reuse, and pay appropriate acknowledgements.

# 1. Primary and Secondary Source Research

Before we get into figuring out what all goes into a map or a timeline, the most important thing is to figure out what kinds of questions to ask of our data. In order to do that, we will be gathering research for this project to give context to the letters -- events, themes, and people in the letters. Our timelines and our maps will explore something in the letters, and they will likely contain other primary and secondary sources to help tell the story. 

## What are Primary and Secondary Sources
<!--picture of primary source?-->
Primary sources are often considered more "direct" pieces of evidence that are directly from someone's point of view or report on what is happening in the moment. These could include things like 
* letters (ahem!)
* newspapers 
* interviews
* autobiographies or diaries
* photographs

...and more! 

**Bias in primary sources.** Just because a primary source is considered direct or in "real time," it is still from the point of view of someone who (like all of us!) has opinions, perspectives, and bias. All historical documents are written by an author with a specific point of view, and no matter how objective the author may try to appear, their unique perspectives and inclinations influence the document. Keep this in mind! 

Secondary sources are usually interpretive, aren't usually published,posted, or shared in the moment something is occurring, and often include primary sources in discussion with ideas or hypotheses. This could include things like 
* scholarly articles
* books and book chapters
* websites (blogs, articles, reviews, etc.)
* ...and more!

## Finding Resources
You can find both primary and secondary sources in a number of places for researching topics from the Smith Collection. For our upcoming projects, we will look in several places, including, but not limited to:
* Websites (i.e. blogs, news sites, .orgs, .govs, etc.). 
    * Blogs can show you someone else's perspective on a related topic, link to other sources, etc.
    * You can find reports and data on government or organizational websites like the <a href="https://archives.gov">National Archives and Records Administration</a> or <a href="http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/">Mississippi History Now</a>, from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.
    * Wikipedia (gasp!) can even get you started with background information on a topic you're unfamiliar with! The external and reference links at the bottom of the page are also usually good breadcrubms to follow. 
* <a href="https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw">Library books</a>. Books (or book chapters) are a great way to take a deep dive into a topic. For establishing a foundation for a research topic that involves culture, history, major events...books are a great place to start.
* <a href="http://libguides.muw.edu/az.php">Library databases</a>. Search library databases for things like scholarly articles, news, reviews, and more.
* Digital collections or archives
    * Our own <a href="https://athenacommons.muw.edu/">AthenaCommons</a> contains digitized letters from the Smith Papers Collection.
    * The University of Mississippi's eGrove repository has a digitized collection of <a href="https://egrove.olemiss.edu/sta_msblubk/">MS Blue Books</a>, which contain historical legislative information relevant to our collection.

## Evaluating resources:

By now, you know that not everything you find on the internet is worth using! As you're looking up resources, keep these things in mind: 

* <b>Relevance.</b> Determine a source's relevance to your topic by asking if it will help you get to where you need to go. It might help influence the direction of your research, but that's ok!
* <b>Origin of the source.</b> Where is this coming from? What is the domain name? Does the resource cite references?
* <b>Purpose of the source.</b> What is this source trying to accomplish? Is it selling a product? Is it to share information/educate? Is it to persuade? Consider if there is an ulterior motive.

## Citing and Reusing sources
1. We are always taught to cite our sources, so expect the sources you use to do the same! Look for citation information within a source, and cite the sources you use.
2. If you find a source you want to reuse (e.g. an image, a screen shot, etc.), make sure you have the permission to do so. Since we are creating maps and timelines using open, online tools, ask yourself if the artist/creator would mind you posting their stuff, and if so, ALWAYS give them recognition! 

<!--check-in 1c -scenarios: find a lengthy source on WPA work and justify using it for a research question; find information on a movie they mention in the letters; You want to talk about women's 'roles' in 20th century american society. Provide a citation for each source-->

# 2. Building a Timeline

Why create a timeline? If you would like to show the progression of or change in data over time, a timeline will visualize this for you. Both maps and timelines use spreadsheets to associate information with a spot on a "map." Timelines associate information (e.g. the sources you find, information from the letters, etc.) with dates and ranges of time.

# 3. Geospatial Data

<p><img src="https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/mapping-images/MS-sample-map.JPG" alt="Screenshot of a map of MS with counties outlined in red, and with 3 points in Tupelo, Pittsboro, and Meridian">

Maps are layers of data represented by shapes, lines, and points. Layers usually include a:
* Base map layer - something you put all of your layers on top of. This could be a historic map, a map with specific boundaries, a topographical map, etc., etc.!
* Shapefiles - these are files that contain shapes, lines, and points that correspond to places, and include information on them. An example would be a point (like a city) and its geographical location (latitude, longitude). Other examples can include county boundaries, rivers, buildings, population (census) data, and routes in between locations. These are just a few possibilities! There are 2 kinds of shapefile data:
    * Vector Data - this is discrete data, like the examples mentioned above. 
    * Raster Data (we will not use raster data in this class) - this includes data that is continuous, like weather patterns or elevation.

## Selecting data
Maps are often built with tables of attributes that correspond to locations. You would collect data **relevant to your question** that you hope to answer through mapping certain points. For example, if you wanted to show the proximity of Mississippi's rivers to certain locations, you would look for the data to accentuate this. Your basemap would not overemphasize streets, but the landscape. Your vector data could include an outline of Mississippi and the shapes rivers make, and your locations (or points) would demonstrate this proximity.
