# Mapping Spatial and Temporal data
Why make a map or a timeline? What's the point? What kinds of questions do these answer?

Think of the data we've already gathered in the Smith letters. Which data allow themselves to tell a spatial story? How can we supplement those data with contextual information that we can incorporate into the already established data?

## Objectives
- Understand what geospatial data is, how it is organized, and what it could include.
- Identify and manage files for creating a timeline or mapping visualization
- Write a research question that includes a using a map or timeline
- Identify subsequent primary and/or secondary sources to support a spatial or temporal analysis

## Lessons
1. Geospatial Data
2. Timelines
3. Primary and Secondary Research
4. Writing a research question and plan

## Ethical considerations
Many maps, especially digital mapping projects, use a 2-dimensional representation (i.e. flat) of the earth, which is just a part of the inaccuracies of our world that maps represent. Like historical records, maps (and even timelines!) are incomplete choices that represent human experience of the world. As you create maps and/or timelines, consider these questions, adapted from <a href="https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/mapping/lessons/?page=4">DH Institutes Curriculum</a>, that critically examine the process of map-making:
* <b>How are you collecting data?</b> Are you gathering data, or using existing data? What are the limitations of either, and what choices lead to this decision (convenience? access? most appropriate?)
* <b>What is missing from your data?</b> If you collect population information, which populations are you including/excluding? What boundaries (county? state? neighborhood?) define the map?
* <b>What symbols represent data?</b> Be aware of the colors and symbols you use to represent information. These choices can affect how others interpret your map! 

# 1. Geospatial Data
<!--map image-->
Maps are layers of data represented by shapes, lines, and points. Layers usually include a:
* Base map layer - something you put all of your layers on top of. This could be a historic map, a map with specific boundaries, a topographical map, etc., etc.!
* Shapefiles - these are files that contain shapes, lines, and points that correspond to places. An example would be a point (like a city) and its geographical location (latitude, longitude). Other examples can include county boundaries, rivers, buildings, population (census) data, and routes in between locations. These are just a few possibilities! There are 2 kinds of shapefile data:
    * Vector Data - this is discrete data, like the examples mentioned above. 
    * Raster Data (we will not use raster data in this class) - this includes data that is continuous, like weather patterns or elevation.

Maps are often built with tables of attributes that correspond to locations.

## Finding Vector Data?
Points, lines, polygons

## Mapping tools
* QGIS (requires download)
* Google MyMaps
* StoryMapJS

## Check-in
<!--multiple choice - define terms, give an example of what vector data could include, show a map, and describe the layers within it-->

# 2. Timelines
Both maps and timelines use spreadsheets to associate information with a spot on a "map." Timelines associate information with dates, ranges of time. Why create a timeline? If you would like to show the progression of or change in data over time, a timeline will visualize this for you.

## Timeline tools
* TimelineJS
* Palladio
* Neatline
