# Mapping Space and Time
Why make a map or a timeline? What's the point? What kinds of questions do these answer?

Think of the data we've already gathered in the Smith letters. Which data allow themselves to tell a spatial story? How can we supplement those data with contextual information that we can incorporate into the already established data?

## Objectives


## Lessons

## Ethical considerations
Many maps, especially digital mapping projects, use a 2-dimensional representation (i.e. flat) of the earth, which is just a part of the inaccuracies of our world that maps represent. Like historical records, maps (and even timelines!) are incomplete choices that represent human experience of the world. As you create maps and/or timelines, consider these questions, adapted from <a href="https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/mapping/lessons/?page=4">DH Institutes Curriculum</a>, that critically examine the process of map-making:
* <b>How are you collecting data?</b> Are you gathering data, or using existing data? What are the limitations of either, and what choices lead to this decision (convenience? access? most appropriate?)
* <b>What is missing from your data?</b> If you collect population information, which populations are you including/excluding? What boundaries (county? state? neighborhood?) define the map?
* <b>What symbols represent data?</b> Be aware of the colors and symbols you use to represent information. These choices can affect how others interpret your map! 

# 1. Geospatial Data
Maps are layers.

What data do you need to make a map?

* Base map layer
* Shapefiles
    * Vector Data
    * Raster Data (we will not use raster data in this class)

## More on Vector Data
Points, lines, polygons

## Mapping tools
* QGIS (requires download)
* Google MyMaps
* StoryMapJS

# 2. Timelines
Why a timeline? Weaving narratives together over time
Showing progression of change in data over time

## Timeline tools
* TimelineJS
* Palladio
* Neatline
