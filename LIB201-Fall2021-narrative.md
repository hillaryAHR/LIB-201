The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection consists of letters ranging from 1908 all the way up to 1977. However, the bulk of the letters (referred to as the “Smith Family Papers” from here on out) that are already transcribed are from 1929-1944. These letters span from the Great Depression, through World War II, and into the aftermath of the economic upturn that followed. The Smith family was not particularly wealthy, but were also not especially poor. As such, their experiences and the recording of their experiences helps to shed a light on what life might have been like for an average, white Southern American family in such interesting times - they owned their own land, but lived in a rural, lower-income area of the state, where many of their neighbors of color often did not own land, could not participate in many areas of civic or government life, and often did labor on other people’s land. 

The Smith Family Papers consisted of letters between the family members about a variety of topics: family drama/gossip, the War, and the economy. Despite what was occurring abroad, the family still had its own personal affairs and problems to attend to and one could argue that to them, these things were equally if not more important.

# About the Project

## About the project team

Several of the letters were transcribed by classes that came before us, leaving us to focus more on transcribing mid-20th century letters specifically from the 1940’s. Future classes will continue this work, transcribing more letters and analyzing them in novel ways. Our team was made up of: 
* Tyler Dean
    * Senior Public History major from Hollywood, FL
    * Introductory content and co-creator of Women's Lives section
* Olivia Sagely
    * Senior Communication major from Smithville, MS
    * Mapped "Electrifying the South" and led the WWII section development
* Alyssa Cox
    * Junior Psychology major with a minor in Family Studies from Nettleton, MS 
    * Created the timeline and contributed to the WWII section
* Crystal Adams
    * Junior Family Science major with minors in Psychology and Digital Studies from Golden, MS
    * Created network analysis and contributed to the WWII section 
* Johanna Ericson
    * Senior Communications major with a minor in Digital Studies from Corinth, MS.
    * Co-creator of the Women's Lives section
*  Hillary Richardson
    * Coordinator of Undergraduate and Information Literacy, and instructor of Digital Studies.
    * Project manager, content editor

Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donators of the Smith Papers, have also contributed to the creation of various projects, ideations, and discussion that are ongoing and continue to influence the directions we take.

## About the Smith Papers

The Smith Papers collection is broad and includes the names, daily affairs, and relationships of hundreds of people. The Fall 2021 project focuses on the 5 members of the Smith Family: Sam (Daddy), Pauline (Mother), Bernice, Christine, Martha, and Sonny Boy. For more in-depth information about these people, read our [About the Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vo_YCCW18aam14CnAG8KyYYDlV37zODsFaqP_6_Flgk/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### Cleaning Processes, Data, and Documentation

**Metadata** - In addition to collecting item-level metadata and transcriptions for each letter, we tagged letters with various metadata tags to identify people, places, and other research points. The metadata gathered for this class will contribute to the Smith Papers Collection in <a href="https://athenacommons.muw.edu/smithpapers/">AthenaCommons, our institutional repository</a>.

**Relational data** - Each letter was tagged to identify names of individuals mentioned. Because each letter referred to people differently (i.e. "Mother" v. "Sweetheart," or "Chris" v. "Christine"), we chose standardized names for identifiable people in the Smith family, and we reconciled names for people that were clearly the same, but had variations in spelling or transcription. For names that were not identifiable, too common (i.e. Mary, Elizabeth, Bill, etc.), or unclear, we cleaned the relational data that we could, and left the rest alone to preserve the diversity of the network. Our spreadsheets of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJeDKaSWJwYFjgCT7rvsQgo52mrRe7ibo9Uqh7BS9qE/edit?usp=sharing">identified names is here</a>.

**Text Cleaning** - we created stop words lists for different iterations of text analyses. An example of stopwords lists used in letters from Pauline to her children and letters from Sonny Boy during his basic training for WWII <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHXxc9BZf7kstSOFQcdfGKK3EyD92HDqkHo7ww7G42c/edit?usp=sharing">can be found here.</a>

# Women's Lives

## Network Analysis

This network analysis used letters from 1931 to 1943 from the Smith Family Papers. These letters are sent and received by members of the Smith family, mainly, and center around Pittsboro, Mississippi, but expand around the southern United States as time goes on. The main letter sender (source) and recipient (target) is the matriarch of the family, Pauline Smith, which is shown in this network analysis. Since Pauline’s node is in the center and is the largest node with most edges coming of it, it means she has the most degree centrality. 

![Screenshot of network analysis, with Pauline at center of the network](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrariveCapture1.PNG)

This shows that Pauline has the most imediate connections of anyone else invloved in the letters. Her husband Sam Hawkins Smith and children Bernice, Martha, Christine, and Sam Ellard (SonnyBoy) Smith have the next largest nodes and number of edges. They are the main sources of this network, while most other names only appear as targets. 

![Screenshot of network analysis, showing Pauline's node size compared to others](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrativeCapture2.PNG)

The reason Pauline, her husband, and her children appear in this way is because they have directed edges, meaning they wrote letters, while most others are undirected, since they were merely mentioned in the letters. 

### No Analysis is Perfect
While this analysis is a fairly accurate representation of the letters in terms of sources and targets, it is not without problems from obstacles or human errors, such as not knowing all people involved in the letters, not being able to differentiate from similarly spelled names, and multiple variations of the same first names without surnames lead to problems. It was difficult to confidently say if two names were meant to be the same person or were two separate people in many cases. Human errors like misspellings, correcting two close names as one person, leaving two close names as two people, and transcribing something incorrectly kept the analysis from being completely accurate. Some specific human errors are that there are two nodes for Christine in the graph, an extra Pauline node and multiple names chosen to be one person or two without actual confirmation of either. 

![Screenshot of network analysis without edges to show names](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrativeCapture6.PNG)

Since the graph does not include everyone Pauline was close to, the entire collection of letters, and cannot account for everyone in Pittsboro at the time, it is limited in its analysis. Even with the human errors, limitations, and obstacles, this network analysis graph shows the centrality of matriarch Pauline Smith to her family and the wide expanse that this collection of letters reaches.

## Men and Money

The women of the Smith family lived in times that defined a generation, a Great Depression, and a second Great War greatly influenced the lives that lived through them. This section focuses on two women’s lives, and their everyday relationships with 2 very normal things: men and money. Christine’s letters back and forth with the variety of boys that attempted to court her painted a picture of courtship practices of the early 20th century: flowers, gifts, and extravagant dates. Pauline’s letters to her children, specifically her adult and college-aged children show how she managed money and kept her family afloat during one of the most tumultuous times in American history, and thus how she was the de facto economic head of her household.

### 20th Century Dating

![Type-written excerpt from Christine's letter telling her mother, telling her about 3 men - a navy captain, the Governer of the Virgin Islands, and a man named Johnnie Brons - who are courting her](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19421215-smith-christine-001.png)
*Source: from "Letter from Christine Smith to Pauline Smith, December 15, 1942," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)*

**Transcript:** 
One of the Captains brought me back two big orchids from Balboa the other night.. One white one and one purple. It was certainly a surprise to me as I didn't even know his name. He handed me the box and said, "this is for you for being in such a good humor at four o' clock in the morning."

The Governor of the Virgin Islands has flown in twice since I Wrote you about my experience with him. He worried me considerably about going out, but I told him that my future husband was in town. Then he started trying to get me to slip off and meet him somewhefe clandestinely. All very mysterious and romantic. Frances says that he is a personal friend of Roosevelt's.

Johnnie Brons and I have been having a lot of fun lately. He is the co-pilot who makes trips to Africa, previously a newspaper reporter. We read stories together, go bolling, shimning, etc. Sunday he wanted me to go to a symphony with him, but I had to sleep.

![handwritten letter from Christine to her mother, detailing the romantic attempts of Jack Duffield to court her](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19421031-smith-christine-001.png)

*Source: from "Letter from Christine Smith to Pauline Smith, October 31, 1942," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)* 

**Transcript:**
"I've  never spent such a week- a chartered fishing boat one day, expensive dinners every night at the best places, all  the shows, a rented convertible to ride. on with no gas- rationing. He also  bought my lunch everyday and came for me at the end of the day."

As shown here, the economic impact that courtship had was not small. Christine had spent a good deal of time with Jack Duffield and he had a 
large sum of money that he was all too eager to spend on her. Additionally, this wasn't the only suitor. Eligible women in the early 20th century often chose from multiple suitors at the same time.

Staying available and accruing social capital was a normal cultural practice, though at times could be overwhelming. Christine's dating experiences sound interesting and exciting, but for her was at times confusing and dizzying.

![Christine writes to her mother feeling "as if I'm spinning wildly on a wheel getting dizzier"](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/From%20mcj-dp018-19421031-smith-christine-002.png)

*Source: from "Letter from Christine Smith to Pauline Smith, October 31, 1942," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)*

**Transcript:**
Honestly, mother, at times I feel as if I'm spinning wildly on a wheel getting dizzier. Things are moving and happening so fast  that nothing is surprising anymore  Some day I'll have a lot of funny storys to tell.”

### Economics of Motherhood
Pauline’s letters to her children, specifically her adult and college-aged children show how she - a stay at home mother (who generated little income) - managed money for her family. In several letters, she asks about her kid's finanaces, describes the cost of things like clothes, food, and repairs, and plays an active role in monitoring her family's spending habits following a major economic depression. Like most mothers, she simultaneously wished the best for and worried about her daughter's finances 

![Pauline shows concern for Christine](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19390315-smith-pauline.png)
*Source: from "Letter from Pauline Smith to Christine Smith, March 15, 1939," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)*

**Transcript:**
"“I hope you found the job and that you'll like it. I can't keep from worrying about you knowing that your funds are so low now, I do hope you can work for awhile and get what you want and like.”

Pauline also kept in touch with other relatives and friends, knowing how they were doing financially because she gave them money. Of note, here, is that Katherine chose to ask Pauline to borrow money instead of anyone else in the family.

![Katherine gets a job as an assistant commercial teacher, and asks to borrow money](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19370921-smith-pauline.png)

*Source: from "Letter from Pauline Smith to Christine Smith, September 21, 1937," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)*

**Transcript:**
“Katherine got the peace in Eupora school as asst. commercial teacher. It pays $50.00 and the board is $20.00. She left yesterday. I'm mighty glad she got the place even if she doesn't get so much pay it will be a lot of help to all of them. She came up here yesterday and said she was in a big tight spot and didnt know who to go to except me. She wanted to borrow $1500  to get started off on as she didn't even have money to get down there on.”

The Smiths were not wealthy, but they were also not destitute, so they often were generous with their funds to those they deemed in need. In this letter, Pauline  mentioned that she saw a boy selling magazine subscriptions to study medicine at Ole Miss, and goes on to include that her husband had purchased a $250 subscription to “True Story” which she seemed just a tad disappointed about.

![Pauline manages subscription costs](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19380110-smith-pauline.png)

**Transcript:**
"...while I was out the other day a boy came by who was taking subscriptions to magazines to keep pay his expenses at Ole Miss where he is studying medicine. What magazine do you suppose your father paid $250 for a yrs. subscription? - ‘True Story’"

### Text Analysis of Pauline's Letters
To get a better idea of potential patterns in Pauline's letters regarding finances, Tyler conducted a named entity recognition analysis, a topic modeling analysis, and an n-gram analysis. Each test's results varied. The Named Entity Analysis for example, miscategorized quite a few individual entities. Some of the less relevant examples include SonnyBoy being classified as an organization, and “weight 8 lbs” being classified as a person. However, what was especially important was that some individual numbers were classified as money without a dollar sign, and the dollar sign was sometimes classified as a number. While this was interesting, without a close reading of the texts, it is impossible to fully correct these issues and conjecture might lead to wildly inaccurate conclusions. However, 58 of the 1150 entities (or 5%) identified were MONEY. Additionally, some of these amounts were miscategorized as CARDINAL.

![NER Analysis of Pauline's letters showing money columns](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/ner-pauline.JPG)

The Topic Modeling did not seem to reveal anything, unfortunately, after 2 rounds of adding stop words, at least not with regards to finances. There was no number commonly preceded by a dollar sign, and words like lend, loan, and spend were not frequently paired with financial terms. Additionally, words like make, job, or work were not common enough.

Money remained with 12 instances but a shift in focus revealed some other relevant terms. Sent, send, work, make, and job each appeared in the selection of letters at least 20 times. And while some of these words may appear more often because of their multiple meanings, job and work appearing so often is important to consider. 

![ngram analysis of Pauline's letters, showing money, job, and work as significant words](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/ngram-pauline.png)

Unfortunately, even after spending significantly more time rerunning the programs and adding to the list of stop words, some outliers still managed to slip through the cracks. Very often two phrases that the algorithm considered separate would be near-identical or even actually identical, save the addition of a space at the end (which was overlooked in the cleaning process). This made cleaning incredibly difficult and tedious, and ultimately a stopping point was agreed upon when one of the excluded words did not make it into the NGram analysis.

# Electrifying the South

In several of Pauline's letters, she mentions the pending arrival of the TVA, and therefore electricity in their home in Pittsboro for the first time. Students researched this progression of events and created a timeline and a map to showcase two angles of the TVA's arrival: the domestic and the political. 

## Pathway to Electricity

On May 18, 1933, Congressmen passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act which covered the Northeastern portion of Mississippi which started the path to electricity. The first step in electrifying the state of Mississippi started in the town of Tupelo. On February 7, 1934. Tupelo was the first city in Mississippi to purchase electricity through the Tennessee Valley Authority. Alcorn County was the next county to purchase electricity through the TVA on June 1, 1934. Following the Great Depression, the people in this area sought out something that would make their rural farm life easier to handle. Doing this paved the way for many more small, rural farm areas to bring back their way of life after something so devastating. On November 11, 1934, more areas of Northeastern Mississippi purchased electricity to power their farms. It is said that electricity made their chores, farm work, and other household duties easier, though it did not reduce the demand.

## Tension in private companies and cooperative models

[![Screenshot of TVA map with power lines, income by county, and individual points with images](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/map2.png "Map of TVA lines, income levels, and Individual points")](https://arcg.is/1W09a11) 

Click the map to explore the individual points and to learn more about the significant locations of early TVA development sites.

This map brings together the area covered by TVA electricity lines, household income by county, and locations of significant events. The purple area is the Median Household Income in the past 12 months (inflation-adjusted dollars to last year in the 5-year range). For Calhoun County, a historically rural and low-income country, the median household income in this area is estimated to be $37,263. Pittsboro, the county seat of Calhoun County, is where the Smith Family lived. From the letters the Smith Family wrote, one can see the Smith Family did not have access to privatized electricity that bigger and more afflent cities -- like Jackson and Columbus -- did. The Great Depression left many families living in desperate poverty. President Roosevelt organized the New Deal to help bring jobs, electricity, and economical growth. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established in 1933 as an initiative to establish low cost, electrical power to rural areas in seven southern states. Tupelo, Alcorn County, Columbus, Monroe County, and Pittsboro were just a few of the rural areas in Mississippi to receive electricity during the 1930s (<a href="https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/the-1930s">"The 1930s", TVA History.</a>). 

Power companies wanted power for everyone else as much as they wanted it for themselves. Although most companies were adaptable with the TVA, some were not. There was much tension between small electric companies and the TVA. In February of 1936, the Alabama Power Company, founded in 1906, brought a case against the TVA to the Supreme Court because they felt that the US government was overstepping its bounds in competing with power companies. According to <a href="https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/ashwander-v-tennessee-valley-authority/">The Tennessee Encyclopedia,</a> “The court ruled in favor of TVA, holding that Congress had authority to construct dams and sell electricity, a by-product.” There was also another court case, Tennessee Power Company v. TVA in 1939 regarding the same issues.

# World War II

## War is Declared

In September of 1939, the beginnings of World War II were being broadcast to radios all over the United States, and the Smiths were tuning in. 

![Handwritten letter from Martha Smith to her mother saying, "Do you hear the war news? It is pretty scary now. I want to listen, and I..."](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19390918-smith-martha-004-a.JPG)

![next page of handwritten letter from Martha Smith to her mother saying, "...don't. Ut us si fascinating and so horrible."](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19390918-smith-martha-004-b.JPG)

## Sonny Boy enlists

Sam E. Smith (or "Sonny Boy") enlisted in the U.S. Army on June 23rd, 1943 (Ancestry.com, _U.S., World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1943_[database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2005.).

![Scanned image of Sam Ellard Smith's draft registration card, on yellowed paper with black typewritten text and Sam's signature](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/Smith-DraftRegCard.jpg)
*Source: Ancestry.com.* U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 [database on-line]. *Lehi, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010.*

At this writing, his letters from basic training tell about his experiences in Fort Knox, KY, Fort George G Mead, MD, and an undisclosed location in London. Students wanted to get an idea what basic training was like through Sonny Boy's retelling of his experience, and performed a text analysis on the letters to get an idea. In general, reading the letters tells you he enjoyed weapons training, did not like "KP" or Kitchen Police duty, endured some harsh winter conditions (like sleeping on the cold ground), and generally got along with other men in his company. One letter that exemplifies this experience is from October 25, 1943. He says:

![Sonny boy describes weapons training](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19431025-smith-sonnyboy.png)
*Source: from "Letter from Sonny Boy Smith to Pauline Smith, October 25, 1943," from the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen Smith Family Papers, Beulah Culbertson Archives and Special Collections, Mississippi University for Women. (electronic version)*

"Dear Mother, I haven’t had time to write for the last three days. We have been shooting the 75. That is a really good gun. We knocked targets to splinters three thousand yards away. We use binoculars to sight with after this week is over we will have two weeks of battle training and our basic will be over. They say that we have very scant rations and very little sleep on battle training.”

## Text Analysis of Basic Training Letters 

![Ngram analysis of Sonny boy's WWII correspondence, with words tank, army, and knox as the largest words](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/WW2-ngram.png)

An ngram analysis of 50 letters from Sonny Boy's training shows that handling weapons and equipment was a prominent discussion in Sonny Boy's letters, with "tank," being one of the largest words, featuring smaller words like "drive," "tanks," and "gun." Other words like "cold," "ground," and "work" show some of the less-than-ideal conditions he trained in. While this example needs a few more cleaning iterations, this analysis is still telling.

Sonny Boy's experience seems comparable to other GI's recorded experiences. According to the article 
<a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/training-american-gi">Training the American GI</a>, most of the men that joined during this time were volunteers, so they were unaware of how intense basic training was going to be: “The new additions were mostly young 
Americans who would normally have been pursuing jobs, schooling, and family life, but instead were answering the nation’s call to arms. Many of them had never even traveled outside their home state, let alone Europe, Asia, or the Pacific Islands. Preparing these millions of civilians for 
war would be one of the military’s most daunting challenges.” 

According to <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~addesa01/documents/Myfatherandhisfather.pdf">"My Father and His Father: An Analysis of World War II Correspondence,"</a>, another GI tells describes shooting weapons in similar manner that Sonny Boy does: "March 5, 1944: By the way, Dad, I think you’d really love that carbine we fired Saturday. (I’m also a sharpshooter in that.) The thing is a powerful .30 caliber up to 600 yards. It is real light – 5 pounds – has very little kick, and is semi-automatic, just keep pulling the trigger. An ideal deer rifle, one of the boys told me."

Most of these people were in the same shoes as Sonnyboy, not knowing what was going to happen or what they were about to endure. Another Mississippi volunteer, Ben Quintana, says: “When you go through boot camp and they pass you...you’re ready to fight anything” (<a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/training-american-gi">"Training the American GI"</a>) Before reporting to a ship or heading overseas, however, most recruits went through more specialized training for their specific duties within their branch of the military. Some learned how to operate radios or other communications equipment.” Sonny Boy describes one of those specialized trainings in a letter to his mother, saying "we will be pretty busy getting ready for battle training we leave at four o'clock in the morning....we had a class in camouflage and concealment yesterday...”
