The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection consists of letters ranging from 1908 all the way up to 1977. However, the bulk of the letters (referred to as the “Smith Family Papers” from here on out) that are already transcribed are from 1929-1944. These letters span from the Great Depression, through World War II, and into the aftermath of the economic upturn that followed. The Smith family was not particularly wealthy, but were also not especially poor. As such, their experiences and the recording of their experiences helps to shed a light on what life might have been like for an average, white Southern American family in such interesting times - they owned their own land, but lived in a rural, lower-income area of the state, where many of their neighbors of color often did not own land, could not participate in many areas of civic or government life, and often did labor on other people’s land. 

The Smith Family Papers consisted of letters between the family members about a variety of topics: family drama/gossip, the War, and the economy. Despite what was occurring abroad, the family still had its own personal affairs and problems to attend to and one could argue that to them, these things were equally if not more important.

# About the Project

## About the project team

Several of the letters were transcribed by classes that came before us, leaving us to focus more on transcribing mid-20th century letters specifically from the 1940’s. Future classes will continue this work, transcribing more letters and analyzing them in novel ways. Our team was made up of: 
* Tyler Dean
    * Senior Public History major from Hollywood, FL
    * Introductory content and co-creator of Women's Lives section
* Olivia Sagely
    * Senior Communication major from Smithville, MS
    * Mapped "Electrifying the South" and led the WWII section development
* Alyssa Cox
    * Junior Psychology major with a minor in Family Studies from Nettleton, MS 
    * Created the timeline and contributed to the WWII section
* Crystal Adams
    * Junior Family Science major with minors in Psychology and Digital Studies from Golden, MS
    * Created network analysis and contributed to the WWII section 
* Johanna Ericson
    * Senior Communications major with a minor in Digital Studies from Corinth, MS.
    * Co-creator of the Women's Lives section
*  Hillary Richardson
    * Coordinator of Undergraduate and Information Literacy, and instructor of Digital Studies.
    * Project manager, content editor

Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donators of the Smith Papers, have also contributed to the creation of various projects, ideations, and discussion that are ongoing and continue to influence the directions we take.

## About the Smith Papers

The Smith Papers collection is broad and includes the names, daily affairs, and relationships of hundreds of people. The Fall 2021 project focuses on the 5 members of the Smith Family: Sam (Daddy), Pauline (Mother), Bernice, Christine, Martha, and Sonny Boy. For more in-depth information about these people, read our [About the Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vo_YCCW18aam14CnAG8KyYYDlV37zODsFaqP_6_Flgk/edit?usp=sharing) document.

# Women's Lives

The women of the Smith family lived in times that defined a generation, a Great Depression, and a second Great War greatly influenced the lives that lived through them. This section focuses on two women’s lives, and their everyday relationships with 2 very normal things: men and money. Christine’s letters back and forth with the variety of boys that attempted to court her painted a picture of courtship practices of the early 20th century: flowers, gifts, and extravagant dates. Pauline’s letters to her children, specifically her adult and college-aged children show how she managed money and kept her family afloat during one of the most tumultuous times in American history, and thus how she was the de facto economic head of her household.
