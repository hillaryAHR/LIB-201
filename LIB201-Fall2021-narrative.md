The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection consists of letters ranging from 1908 all the way up to 1977. However, the bulk of the letters (referred to as the “Smith Family Papers” from here on out) that are already transcribed are from 1929-1944. These letters span from the Great Depression, through World War II, and into the aftermath of the economic upturn that followed. The Smith family was not particularly wealthy, but were also not especially poor. As such, their experiences and the recording of their experiences helps to shed a light on what life might have been like for an average, white Southern American family in such interesting times - they owned their own land, but lived in a rural, lower-income area of the state, where many of their neighbors of color often did not own land, could not participate in many areas of civic or government life, and often did labor on other people’s land. 

The Smith Family Papers consisted of letters between the family members about a variety of topics: family drama/gossip, the War, and the economy. Despite what was occurring abroad, the family still had its own personal affairs and problems to attend to and one could argue that to them, these things were equally if not more important.

# About the Project

## About the project team

Several of the letters were transcribed by classes that came before us, leaving us to focus more on transcribing mid-20th century letters specifically from the 1940’s. Future classes will continue this work, transcribing more letters and analyzing them in novel ways. Our team was made up of: 
* Tyler Dean
    * Senior Public History major from Hollywood, FL
    * Introductory content and co-creator of Women's Lives section
* Olivia Sagely
    * Senior Communication major from Smithville, MS
    * Mapped "Electrifying the South" and led the WWII section development
* Alyssa Cox
    * Junior Psychology major with a minor in Family Studies from Nettleton, MS 
    * Created the timeline and contributed to the WWII section
* Crystal Adams
    * Junior Family Science major with minors in Psychology and Digital Studies from Golden, MS
    * Created network analysis and contributed to the WWII section 
* Johanna Ericson
    * Senior Communications major with a minor in Digital Studies from Corinth, MS.
    * Co-creator of the Women's Lives section
*  Hillary Richardson
    * Coordinator of Undergraduate and Information Literacy, and instructor of Digital Studies.
    * Project manager, content editor

Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donators of the Smith Papers, have also contributed to the creation of various projects, ideations, and discussion that are ongoing and continue to influence the directions we take.

## About the Smith Papers

The Smith Papers collection is broad and includes the names, daily affairs, and relationships of hundreds of people. The Fall 2021 project focuses on the 5 members of the Smith Family: Sam (Daddy), Pauline (Mother), Bernice, Christine, Martha, and Sonny Boy. For more in-depth information about these people, read our [About the Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vo_YCCW18aam14CnAG8KyYYDlV37zODsFaqP_6_Flgk/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### Cleaning Processes, Data, and Documentation

**Metadata** - In addition to collecting item-level metadata and transcriptions for each letter, we tagged letters with various metadata tags to identify people, places, and other research points. The metadata gathered for this class will contribute to the Smith Papers Collection in <a href="https://athenacommons.muw.edu/smithpapers/">AthenaCommons, our institutional repository</a>.

**Relational data** - Each letter was tagged to identify names of individuals mentioned. Because each letter referred to people differently (i.e. "Mother" v. "Sweetheart," or "Chris" v. "Christine"), we chose standardized names for identifiable people in the Smith family, and we reconciled names for people that were clearly the same, but had variations in spelling or transcription. For names that were not identifiable, too common (i.e. Mary, Elizabeth, Bill, etc.), or unclear, we cleaned the relational data that we could, and left the rest alone to preserve the diversity of the network. Our spreadsheets of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJeDKaSWJwYFjgCT7rvsQgo52mrRe7ibo9Uqh7BS9qE/edit?usp=sharing">identified names is here</a>.

**Text Cleaning** - we created stop words lists for different iterations of text analyses. An example of stopwords lists used in letters from Pauline to her children and letters from Sonny Boy during his basic training for WWII <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHXxc9BZf7kstSOFQcdfGKK3EyD92HDqkHo7ww7G42c/edit?usp=sharing">can be found here.</a>

# Women's Lives

## Network Analysis

This network analysis used letters from 1931 to 1943 from the Smith Family Papers. These letters are sent and received by members of the Smith family, mainly, and center around Pittsboro, Mississippi, but expand around the southern United States as time goes on. The main letter sender (source) and recipient (target) is the matriarch of the family, Pauline Smith, which is shown in this network analysis. Since Pauline’s node is in the center and is the largest node with most edges coming of it, it means she has the most degree centrality. 

![Screenshot of network analysis, with Pauline at center of the network](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrariveCapture1.PNG)

This shows that Pauline has the most imediate connections of anyone else invloved in the letters. Her husband Sam Hawkins Smith and children Bernice, Martha, Christine, and Sam Ellard (SonnyBoy) Smith have the next largest nodes and number of edges. They are the main sources of this network, while most other names only appear as targets. 

![Screenshot of network analysis, showing Pauline's node size compared to others](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrativeCapture2.PNG)

The reason Pauline, her husband, and her children appear in this way is because they have directed edges, meaning they wrote letters, while most others are undirected, since they were merely mentioned in the letters. 

### No Analysis is Perfect
While this analysis is a fairly accurate representation of the letters in terms of sources and targets, it is not without problems from obstacles or human errors, such as not knowing all people involved in the letters, not being able to differentiate from similarly spelled names, and multiple variations of the same first names without surnames lead to problems. It was difficult to confidently say if two names were meant to be the same person or were two separate people in many cases. Human errors like misspellings, correcting two close names as one person, leaving two close names as two people, and transcribing something incorrectly kept the analysis from being completely accurate. Some specific human errors are that there are two nodes for Christine in the graph, an extra Pauline node and multiple names chosen to be one person or two without actual confirmation of either. 

![Screenshot of network analysis without edges to show names](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/NarrativeCapture6.PNG)

Since the graph does not include everyone Pauline was close to, the entire collection of letters, and cannot account for everyone in Pittsboro at the time, it is limited in its analysis. Even with the human errors, limitations, and obstacles, this network analysis graph shows the centrality of matriarch Pauline Smith to her family and the wide expanse that this collection of letters reaches.

## Men and Money

The women of the Smith family lived in times that defined a generation, a Great Depression, and a second Great War greatly influenced the lives that lived through them. This section focuses on two women’s lives, and their everyday relationships with 2 very normal things: men and money. Christine’s letters back and forth with the variety of boys that attempted to court her painted a picture of courtship practices of the early 20th century: flowers, gifts, and extravagant dates. Pauline’s letters to her children, specifically her adult and college-aged children show how she managed money and kept her family afloat during one of the most tumultuous times in American history, and thus how she was the de facto economic head of her household.

# Electrifying the South

In several of Pauline's letters, she mentions the pending arrival of the TVA, and therefore electricity in their home in Pittsboro for the first time. Students researched this progression of events and created a timeline and a map to showcase two angles of the TVA's arrival: the domestic and the political. 

## Pathway to Electricity

On May 18, 1933, Congressmen passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act which covered the Northeastern portion of Mississippi which started the path to electricity. The first step in electrifying the state of Mississippi started in the town of Tupelo. On February 7, 1934. Tupelo was the first city in Mississippi to purchase electricity through the Tennessee Valley Authority. Alcorn County was the next county to purchase electricity through the TVA on June 1, 1934. Following the Great Depression, the people in this area sought out something that would make their rural farm life easier to handle. Doing this paved the way for many more small, rural farm areas to bring back their way of life after something so devastating. On November 11, 1934, more areas of Northeastern Mississippi purchased electricity to power their farms. It is said that electricity made their chores, farm work, and other household duties easier, though it did not reduce the demand. (For more, see <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/good-equipment-makes-a-good-homemaker-better-promoters-of-domestic-technology-in-mississippi-1930-1940/oclc/57724519&referer=brief_results">*Good Equipment Makes a Good Homemaker Better: Promoters of Domestic Technology in Mississippi, 1930-1940*</a> or <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/technology-as-freedom/oclc/1198929532&referer=brief_results">)

## Tension in private companies and cooperative models

[![Screenshot of TVA map with power lines, income by county, and individual points with images](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/map2.png "Map of TVA lines, income levels, and Individual points")](https://arcg.is/1W09a11) 

Click the map to explore the individual points and to learn more about the significant locations of early TVA development sites.

This map brings together the area covered by TVA electricity lines, household income by county, and locations of significant events. The purple area is the Median Household Income in the past 12 months (inflation-adjusted dollars to last year in the 5-year range). For Calhoun County, a historically rural and low-income country, the median household income in this area is estimated to be $37,263. Pittsboro, the county seat of Calhoun County, is where the Smith Family lived. From the letters the Smith Family wrote, one can see the Smith Family did not have access to privatized electricity that bigger and more afflent cities -- like Jackson and Columbus -- did. The Great Depression left many families living in desperate poverty. President Roosevelt organized the New Deal to help bring jobs, electricity, and economical growth. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established in 1933 as an initiative to establish low cost, electrical power to rural areas in seven southern states. Tupelo, Alcorn County, Columbus, Monroe County, and Pittsboro were just a few of the rural areas in Mississippi to receive electricity during the 1930s (<a href="https://www.tva.com/about-tva/our-history/the-1930s">"The 1930s", TVA History.</a>). 

Power companies wanted power for everyone else as much as they wanted it for themselves. Although most companies were adaptable with the TVA, some were not. There was much tension between small electric companies and the TVA. In February of 1936, the Alabama Power Company, founded in 1906, brought a case against the TVA to the Supreme Court because they felt that the US government was overstepping its bounds in competing with power companies. According to <a href="https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/ashwander-v-tennessee-valley-authority/">The Tennessee Encyclopedia,</a> “The court ruled in favor of TVA, holding that Congress had authority to construct dams and sell electricity, a by-product.” There was also another court case, Tennessee Power Company v. TVA in 1939 regarding the same issues.

# World War II

## War is Declared

In September of 1939, the beginnings of World War II were being broadcast to radios all over the United States, and the Smiths were tuning in. 

![Handwritten letter from Martha Smith to her mother saying, "Do you hear the war news? It is pretty scary now. I want to listen, and I..."](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19390918-smith-martha-004-a.JPG)

## Sonny Boy enlists

Sam E. Smith (or "Sonny Boy") enlisted in the U.S. Army on June 23rd, 1943 (Ancestry.com, _U.S., World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1943_[database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2005.).

![Scanned image of Sam Ellard Smith's draft registration card, on yellowed paper with black typewritten text and Sam's signature](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/Smith-DraftRegCard.jpg)
*Source: Ancestry.com.* U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 [database on-line]. *Lehi, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010.*

At this writing, his letters from basic training tell about his experiences in Fort Knox, KY, Fort George G Mead, MD, and an undisclosed location in London. Students wanted to get an idea what basic training was like through Sonny Boy's retelling of his experience, and performed a text analysis on the letters to get an idea. In general, reading the letters tells you he enjoyed weapons training, did not like "KP" or Kitchen Police duty, endured some harsh winter conditions (like sleeping on the cold ground), and generally got along with other men in his company. One letter that exemplifies this experience is from October 25, 1943. He says:

"Dear Mother, I haven’t had time to write for the last three days. We have been shooting the 75. That is a really good gun. We knocked targets to splinters three thousand yards away. We use binoculars to sight with after this week is over we will have two weeks of battle training and our basic will be over. They say that we have very scant rations and very little sleep on battle training.”
