# A day in the life of the Smiths

The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection consists of letters ranging from 1908 all the way up to 1977. However, the bulk of the letters (referred to as the “Smith Family Papers” from here on out) that are already transcribed are from 1929-1944. These letters span from the Great Depression, through World War II, and into the aftermath of the economic upturn that followed. The Smith family was not particularly wealthy, but were also not especially poor. As such, their experiences and the recording of their experiences helps to shed a light on what life might have been like for an average, white Southern American family in such interesting times - they owned their own land, but lived in a rural, lower-income area of the state, where many of their African American neighbors often did not own land, could not participate in government acts, and often did labor on other people’s land. 

The Smith Family Papers consisted of letters between the family members about a variety of topics: family drama/gossip, the War, and the economy. Despite what was occurring abroad, the family still had its own personal affairs and problems to attend to and one could argue that to them, these things were equally if not more important.
