# Narrative Projects
We have been focusing on "telling the story" of a collection thus far through things like network analyses, timelines, maps, and textual analyses. Now it is time to use _a story_ to tell the story! Thus, we will create a narrative project to weave together the items in the collection (and the artifacts we've created with them!) with what we have learned through our prodding, research, and exploration.

## Lessons
1. Designing an exhibit
2. Writing for the Web
3. Using Markdown and HTML <!--2 instead? re-think order-->
4. Putting together a narrative project

## Required Reading/Tools
- Text Editor (comes installed on most computers)
<!--(   
    - PC users: Notepad
    - Mac user: TextEdit
    - Visual Studio Code is the Microsoft Office equivalent of Notepad or TextEdit. Notepad requires no downloading, but VS Code is more user friendly. https://code.visualstudio.com/)-->

# 1. Designing an Exhibit
What we are essentially doing through our narrative project is creating an online exhibit. And in order to understand the fundamentals of online exhibits, we need to know what goes into the planning and design of one. 

## Design the narrative
As you think about taking your online audience through a tour of the collection, consider the following:
<!--* <b>Who is this audience?</b> - Who are you writing this for? What do you want to say to them and how will you communicate? What is your tone? Language? Purpose? move this to writing on the web? Or just more of it there?-->
* <b>What is the purpose of your narrative?</b> Think about the items you have, the ones you want to highlight, and any themes that you want to use to guide your audience through the story. In other words, what is the thesis of this story? What is the central idea of the narrative?
* <b>What pieces will you use?</b> We have amassed quite a lot of data over the course of the semester. Think about all you have collected, and how it will help you tell the story you've sketched. You may curate anything you've created/collected so far, including: 
    - Letters from the Smith Project
    - External primary sources (photographs, etc.)
    - Secondary research (book chapters, articles, websites, etc.)
    - Metadata (<-- You will need this, regardless!)
    - Projects you've already created
    - Text you've already written
* <b>How will you organize your layout?</b> What system are you using to organize your layout? Is it going to be chronological? Will it be organized by topic?

## Keep in Mind
Designing digital exhibits and writing narratives are **recursive** acts, meaning they may be constantly redesigned from the beginning of the project to the end. You may not end up with what you started in your outline. Keeping an open mind, being flexible with your plan, and keeping (somewhat) organized notes will help you throughout this process!

<!-- ### Check-in
- write the central idea/thesis/purpose statement of your narrative in 1-2 sentences.
- Brainstorm a list of the items (letters, metadata, projects, research, etc.) you'd like to focus on
- sketch an outline of the narrative itself in 3-5 bullet points -->

# 2. Writing for the Web

# 3. Using Markdown and HTML

Markdown is a very simple markup language used for writing for the web. Put simply, Markdown allows us to format our text (like *this* or **this**) using simple cues to let the computer know how we'd like to style our text. These lessons are all written using Markdown, with some HTML here and there. Click the ```Raw``` button at the top of the screen to see what this looks like before being translated by your computer!

Most websites use HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), a way to structure web documents that use nested labels to tell a browser how you want something displayed. Markdown and HTML work together in many cases, so we'll use some HTML elements to format our narrative project. 

## Common Markdown elements

### Headings
Headings are marked with the #, a space, the text, and a hard return. 

In markdown, you would type ```# Heading 1```, but the computer would read:
> # Heading 1

More headings would look like:

### Formatting Text
Style your text to create emphasis with:
> ```**bold**``` --> **bold** or ```*italics*``` --> *italics*

Create an ordered or unordered list:

![](Screenshot of an ordered list in markdown)
![](Screenshot of an unordered list with indentations in markdown)

Highlight quotes with a blockquote:
```> Let's highlight this quote``` turns into
> Let's highlight this quote

Insert an image with an exclamation point, followed by square brackets containing the image URL, and parentheses with the alt text:
> ```![alternative text describing the image](Image URL)```

For more help with markdown elements, there are free, online cheat sheets, like the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdownguide.org</a> 

## Common HTML elements
Hyperlinking text, the most powerful and simple tool of HTML, is the most common way we'll use HTML. To create a hyperlink, structure your text like this:

> ```<a href="hyperlinked-URL">Text you are hyperlinking.</a>```

For more help using HTML, there are free, online tutorials available through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">W3Schools.com</a>
