The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith  Collection (“The Smith Papers”) consists of letters ranging from 1908 to 1977, although the main focus of the research is the years from 1938-1944, the years leading up to and during World War II. The family's children are Sam Ellard Smith, Christine Smith, Martha Smith, and Bernice Smith. Each lived their individual lives, but all remained close to each other,. They were like an outlet, and as communication seemed essential for the entire family. The Smiths recorded their lives, in effect,  efficiently by communicating or writing in one form or the other. The family was not poor or wealthy. So they lived a middle-class lifestyle, were . The Smiths were a close-knit, family that enjoyed one another, and told about their everyday lifvese from Europe to little ole Pittsboro, Mississippi. So, be ready to dive into the melodrama of the Smith family. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of the Smith family collection is to share what life was like in the early 20th century. These letters show us a glimpse into the past, and this website specifically focuses on daily life during World War II. The Smith daughters continue their daily life, working and dating and even marrying, while their little kid brother is across the pond and fighting in the war. Showing a soldier during the war while comparing to his family members back home  highlights the experiences of those affected directly and indirectly by the Second Great War. Not every American may have been in battle, but everyone was affected by the war. It is important to see how everyday life was impacted, as well as see how this family took the bad news in stride and took any good news that came along with it.

## About the Project 
The letters being addressed range from 1929-1944. These letters were donated by Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donors of the Smith Papers, who have also contributed to the creation of ongoing projects, ideations, and ongoing discussions that continue to influence the directions taken. The Smith Papers address various topics ranging from everyday things such as the weather, relationships, and well-being. The topics narrowed down for the Spring 2023 project are entertainment, effects of war seen in letter-writing, and the dating life of the children. The sections in the project include:
1. [Entertainment](##entertainment)
2. [Women's Social Lives](##women's-social-lives)
3. [Letters from the Front Lines](##letters-from-the-front-lines)

## Women’s Social Lives: 

The Smith daughters were not the only women dating and marrying during this time. Several women, in the USA and from other countries, were marrying men from the army, as one article states: ““Home Alive By ‘45.” Home was not only on the minds of millions of Americans in uniforms in 1945; it was also on the minds of between 60,000 to 70,000 women wed by American servicemen during and immediately after World War II” (Nationalww2museum.org <https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/war-brides-act-1945>). Plenty of young people had marriage on their mind, so Christine and Woody were one of many, many couples that wed during these few years!

The USO women did not always have as nice of boys as the Smith daughters did. Bettelee Zahn, who worked with the USO clubs,  “believed that the parents of some of the men who came to the club did not teach them to treat women “with great respect”” (*Good Girls Good Food Good Fun* 94 <https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:2062907/one?qu=good+girls+good+food>). When it came to actually dating servicemen, USO hostesses were not allowed and even casual dating meant penalties or removal from the USO. That does not mean dating did not happen.

## Letters from the Front Lines

### Psychological Effects:
There are many psychological effects of the war in general. However, during this period, it was uncommon to discuss these things. It was understood to never show them at all, especially for men. War is cruel and gruesome, but World War Two was optimistic in American eyes, as explained through entertainment. There was a cause backing up the actions of the troops. Hence, Sonny Boy wrote in a comforting way to his family. However, he faced many challenges in the war. He stated, " If we didn't move fast enough there was a man behind us with a rifle and his ammunition shooting at our heels." (Sonny Boy, much-dp018-19430907-smith-sonnyboy_001.txt).

Which was Sonny Boy describing the actual effects of war when he could. However, there is still a psychological effect that was never explained in any letters, such as did he ever have PTSD or any other impact of the war. As stated in text analysis research, there are statistical effects of war described by Resul Cesur, Joseph J. Sabia, and Erdal Tekin in their paper series, "The Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health." I stated, "If you are and active member of the military service, the authors believe that a member in the army will have a '0.116' chance of needing counseling." Hence, this chance is higher than 0, so there is some effect. Later in the N-Gram analysis or cleaning process of the text analysis shows that there is some sense of affirming language to show that maybe his mental health was good during the war; however, there is still a possibility of him hiding such troubles, such words as good, love, and like.

Overall, the possibility of the psychological effects of war on Sonny Boy can be explained with possible further research and conversing with relatives of him to see if there were any effects. 

### Censorship:
Censoring was a known thing during World War Two and was further investigated by Alvin William McDaniel Jr. in "The war on words: the Office of Censorship in World War II." It was also noticed through various stamps or stamp locations on some of the letters sent out by Sonny Boy. 

![image of censorship stamp on letter](screenshot of letter in folder)

These offices would limit what any troop could say to keep an optimistic view on the war or the cause backing up United States affiliation in the war. Censorship played a significant role in the war and will eventually affect the letters, mainly blacking out lines. This could have caused the results to run in a text analysis researching if there was a positive or negative effect in wartime letters from Sonny Boy and Robert Young.
