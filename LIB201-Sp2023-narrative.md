# Live, Laugh, Love with the Smiths: A Mississippi Family during WWII

![black and white photo of the 5 members of the Smith family in 1950: Sam Hawkins Smith, Sam Ellard Smith, Pauline Smith, Bernice Smith, Martha Smith Womble, and Christine Smith Faust](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/smith-family-group-photo.jpg)

The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection (“The Smith Papers”) consists of letters ranging from 1908 to 1977, although the main focus of the research is the years from 1938-1944, the years leading up to and during World War II. The family's children are Sam Ellard Smith, Christine Smith, Martha Smith, and Bernice Smith. Each lived their individual lives, but all remained close to each other, as communication seemed essential for the entire family. The Smiths recorded their lives, in effect, by communicating or. The family lived a middle-class lifestyle, were close-knit, enjoyed one another, and told about their everyday lives from Europe to little ole Pittsboro, Mississippi. So, be ready to dive into the melodrama of the Smith family.

# Purpose 
The purpose of the Smith family collection is to share what life was like in the early 20th century. These letters show us a glimpse into the past, and this website specifically focuses on daily life during World War II. The Smith daughters are not in combat but they are working, dating and even marrying, while their little brother Sam E. Ellard is across the pond, fighting in the war. Showing a soldier during the war while comparing to his family members back home highlights the experiences of those affected directly and indirectly by the Second Great War. Through the letters, we see how this family grew day to day - from big moments, like the announcement of America’s involvement in the warr, to everyday things, like movies they saw and the night clubs they frequented, dates they went on, what they ate for lunch, and so on. 

# About the Project 
The letters being addressed range from 1929-1944. These letters were donated by Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donors of the Smith Papers, who have also contributed to the creation of ongoing projects, ideations, and ongoing discussions that continue to influence the directions taken. The Smith Papers address various topics ranging from everyday things such as the weather, relationships, and well-being. The topics narrowed down for the Spring 2023 project are entertainment, effects of war seen in letter-writing, and the dating life of the children. The sections in the project include:
1. [Entertainment](##entertainment)
2. [Womens’ Social Life](##womens-social-life)
3. [Letters from the Front Lines](##letters-from-the-front-lines)

## Entertainment

[![Screenshot of timeline of entertainment mentioned in the letters between 1938-1944](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/entertainment-timeline.png)](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Xrmx6ZwW1-Au_XlnhFlPKG4FTOfCjraGjqKfTq1dcrw&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

### Entertainment for Entertainment's Sake
There are tons of forms of entertainment in this era! Radio shows, music, films, books, and more were included in these letters. There was tons of music going on in the 1940s, but one of Sonnyboy’s favorites is hillbilly music, which grew in popularity in the later 1930s. (Best Selling Records charts p.30) One of the biggest songs was [“Pistol Packin Mama” by Al Dexter and the Troopers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwsJDFgBO9k/). People in Europe also enjoyed it, Sonnyboy says in a letter to Pauline, “These Englishmen really 
like hillbilly music! I went to town the other night and played my harp and pretty soon I was the center of attraction” 
![Letter from Sam E. Smith to Pauline Smith, January 22, 1944](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-d-018-19440122-smith-sonnyboy-hillbilly-quote.png?raw=true).

### Race in Film
Movies were a large source of entertainment. *Gone with the Wind* is a popular movie even today, but back then it was rather huge. One of Christine’s suitors, B, had written to her, “Some like it; others dont” ![Letter from B to Christine Smith, January 29, 1940](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19400129-b.png?raw=true). The film puts the Civil War-era South on a pedestal and does not discuss the harmful racial biases in the film. The South did not want to acknowledge the horrible treatment of anyone that was not white, which is very insensitive but also contributes to historical inaccuracies. 

### War propaganda
*Gone with the Wind* is not the only film that had messages to the intended audience. In a paper by Koppes and Black from the book [*Hollywood's America : United States History Through its Films*](https://eds-s-ebscohost-com.libprxy.muw.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=e42ca8e0-a94b-49af-a71e-94569435351e%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=mstate.665279&db=cat00043a), they write that “The Hollywood office became part of OWI [Office of War Information] in June 1942 and began one of the agency’s more important and controversial activities” (p. 158). Elmer Davis was a director at OWI and thought film could be a big tool for propaganda use. However, it was not that easy to get Hollywood in on this, the “OWI now recognized that to inject its propaganda ideas into feature films, the Hollywood bureau had to influence the studios while the films were being produced” (p. 161).

While many films during World War II may have been full of propaganda, that does not mean these were not used for escape. Any form of entertainment can be a form of escapism for people during these times, but films were especially a huge and popular form. Films gave people the chance to ignore current affairs, even if the films took place during the war. Films gave people hope, thinking that if the films have a happy ending then maybe they and their families and friends will all be okay.

### United Services Organization
The USO traveled far and wide to entertain the troops during World War II. The United Services Organization consisted of many different organizations but allowed many celebrities to travel and entertain troops. One known figure was Bob Hope. Who was mentioned by Christine in one of her letters. She addressed how he was leaving the base, which he was popular on. So, USO entertainment was popular on one side of the family.

Letter from Christine Smith to Martha Smith, March 9, 1944

On the other hand, USOs abroad did the same thing as they did in the states: entertain troops and keep the morale high during the war. As Christine was excited about the USO entertainment, Sonny Boy had a different response to the entertainment. He stated, "I didn't enjoy it much."(Sonny Boy, mcj-dp018-19431019-smith-sonnyboy_001.pdf).
Based on the horrible singing, he was not much of a fan. So two opinions are formed on USO entertainment during the war. One side is aw of the celebrities and popularity, and the other is not so great. 
![insert images of Sonny Boy's letter describing his review of USO entertainment pt. 1 & pt. 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19431019-smith-sonnyboy.png)
However, the opinion, the United Service Organization brought entertainment to the troops free of charge and risked their well-being to do so. It was described as "a juggernaut mightier than any enemy" by Erin Blakemore. Blakemore continued to explain in her article the effect the stars and crew had from traveling and putting on shows for the frontline troops.
![USO at 75: The Surprising Fear That Created the USO](https://time.com/4205222/uso-75-years/)
The USO women did not always have as nice of boys as the Smith daughters did. Bettelee Zahn, who worked with the USO clubs,  “believed that the parents of some of the men who came to the club did not teach them to treat women “with great respect”” (*Good Girls Good Food Good Fun* p.94 <https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:2062907/one?qu=good+girls+good+food>). When it came to actually dating servicemen, USO hostesses were not allowed and even casual dating meant penalties or removal from the USO. That does not mean dating did not happen, however!.

# Women’s Social Lives: 
The Smith daughters were not the only women dating and marrying during this time. Several women, in the USA and from other countries, were marrying men from the army.
[adding more]
Plenty of young people had marriage on their mind, so Christine and Woody were one of many, many couples that wed during these few years!

# Letters from the Front Lines

##Psychological Effects:
There are many psychological effects of the war in general. However, during this period, it was uncommon to discuss these things. It was understood to never show them at all, especially for men. War is cruel and gruesome, but World War Two was optimistic in American eyes, as explained through entertainment. There was a cause backing up the actions of the troops. Hence, Sonny Boy wrote in a comforting way to his family. However, he faced many challenges in the war. He stated, " If we didn't move fast enough there was a man behind us with a rifle and his ammunition shooting at our heels." (Sonny Boy, much-dp018-19430907-smith-sonnyboy_001.txt). 
![image of Sonny Boy's letter](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19430907-smith-sonnyboy-2.png?raw=true)
Which was Sonny Boy describing the actual effects of war when he could. However, there is still a psychological effect that was never explained in any letters, such as did he ever have PTSD or any other impact of the war. As stated in text analysis research, there are statistical effects of war described by Resul Cesur, Joseph J. Sabia, and Erdal Tekin in their paper series, "The Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health." I stated, "If you are and active member of the military service, the authors believe that a member in the army will have a '0.116' chance of needing counseling." Hence, this chance is higher than 0, so there is some effect. Later in the N-Gram analysis or cleaning process of the text analysis shows that there is some sense of affirming language to show that maybe his mental health was good during the war; however, there is still a possibility of him hiding such troubles, such words as good, love, and like. 
![image of text analysis ran later in the cleaning process of text analysis”Final N-Gram]

Overall, the possibility of the psychological effects of war on Sonny Boy can be explained with possible further research and conversing with relatives of him to see if there were any effects. 

##Censorship:
Censoring was a known thing during World War Two and was further investigated by Alvin William McDaniel Jr. in "The war on words: the Office of Censorship in World War II." It was also noticed through various stamps or stamp locations on some of the letters sent out by Sonny Boy. 

![image of censorship stamp on letter](censorship letter)

These offices would limit what any troop could say to keep an optimistic view on the war or the cause backing up United States affiliation in the war. Censorship played a significant role in the war and will eventually affect the letters, mainly blacking out lines. This could have caused the results to run in a text analysis researching if there was a positive or negative effect in wartime letters from Sonny Boy and Robert Young.
