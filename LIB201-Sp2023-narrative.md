# Live, Laugh, Love with the Smiths: A Mississippi Family during WWII

![black and white photo of the 5 members of the Smith family in 1950: Sam Hawkins Smith, Sam Ellard Smith, Pauline Smith, Bernice Smith, Martha Smith Womble, and Christine Smith Faust](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/smith-family-group-photo.jpg)

The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection (“The Smith Papers”) consists of letters ranging from 1908 to 1977, although the main focus of our research are the years from 1938-1944, the years leading up to and during World War II. The family's children are Sam Ellard Smith, Christine Smith, Martha Smith, and Bernice Smith. Each lived their individual lives, but all remained close to each other, as communication seemed essential for the entire family. The Smiths recorded their lives, in effect, by communicating through letters. The family lived a middle-class lifestyle, were close-knit, enjoyed one another, and told about their everyday lives from Europe to little ole Pittsboro, Mississippi. So, be ready to dive into the melodrama of the Smith family. An example of how many letters have been written and received, here's a representation of letters to and from Pauline, the collection's biggest letter writer.

# About the Project
The purpose of the Smith family collection is to share what life was like in the early 20th century. These letters show us a glimpse into the past, and this website specifically focuses on daily life during World War II. The Smith daughters are not in combat but they are working, dating and even marrying, while their little brother Sam Ellard Smith is across the pond, fighting in the war. Showing a soldier during the war while comparing to his family members back home highlights the experiences of those affected directly and indirectly by the Second Great War. Through the letters, we see how this family grew day to day - from big moments, like the announcement of America’s involvement in the war, to everyday things, like movies they saw and the night clubs they frequented, dates they went on, what they ate for lunch, and so on. 

The letters being addressed range from 1929-1944. These letters were donated by Steve and Bridget Pieschel, the donors of the Smith Papers, who have also contributed to the creation of ongoing projects, ideations, and ongoing discussions that continue to influence the directions taken. The Smith Papers address various topics ranging from everyday things such as the weather, relationships, and well-being. The topics narrowed down for the Spring 2023 project are entertainment, effects of war seen in letter-writing, and the dating life of Martha and Christine. The sections in the project include:
1. [Entertainment](##entertainment)
2. [Womens’ Social Life](##womens-social-life)
3. [Letters from the Front Lines](##letters-from-the-front-lines)

## Entertainment

[![Screenshot of timeline of entertainment mentioned in the letters between 1938-1944](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/entertainment-timeline.png)](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Xrmx6ZwW1-Au_XlnhFlPKG4FTOfCjraGjqKfTq1dcrw&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)
- This is an image of a [timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZodBgSImuHb1G_YaQLa3dsxCknas8oZDYXB4BkGnD8/edit) to explain the varieties of entertainment throughout the Smith family members lives.

### Entertainment for Entertainment's Sake
There are tons of forms of entertainment in this era! Radio shows, music, films, books, and more were included in these letters. There was tons of music going on in the 1940s, but one of Sonnyboy’s favorites is hillbilly music, which grew in popularity in the later 1930s. (Best Selling Records charts p.30) One of the biggest songs was [“Pistol Packin Mama” by Al Dexter and the Troopers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwsJDFgBO9k/). People in Europe also enjoyed it, Sonnyboy says in a letter to Pauline, “These Englishmen really 
like hillbilly music! I went to town the other night and played my harp and pretty soon I was the center of attraction” 
![Letter from Sam E. Smith to Pauline Smith, January 22, 1944](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-d-018-19440122-smith-sonnyboy-hillbilly-quote.png?raw=true).

### Race in Film
Movies were a large source of entertainment. *Gone with the Wind* was released in 1939, on the verge of the war. One of Christine’s suitors, B, had written to her, “Some like it; others dont” ![Letter from B to Christine Smith, January 29, 1940](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19400129-b.png?raw=true). 

The film puts the Civil War-era South on a pedestal and contains harmful racial biases. The South did not want to acknowledge the horrible treatment of anyone that was not white, which is very insensitive but also contributes to historical inaccuracies in the film.  

### War propaganda
*Gone with the Wind* is not the only film that had messages to the intended audience. In a paper by Koppes and Black from the book [*Hollywood's America : United States History Through its Films*](https://eds-s-ebscohost-com.libprxy.muw.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=e42ca8e0-a94b-49af-a71e-94569435351e%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=mstate.665279&db=cat00043a), they write that “The Hollywood office became part of OWI [Office of War Information] in June 1942 and began one of the agency’s more important and controversial activities” (p. 158). Elmer Davis was a director at OWI and thought film could be a big tool for propaganda use during the war. However, it was not that easy to get Hollywood in on this. The “OWI now recognized that to inject its propaganda ideas into feature films, the Hollywood bureau had to influence the studios while the films were being produced” (p. 161).

While many films during World War II may have been full of propaganda, that does not mean these were not used for escape. Any form of entertainment can be a form of escapism for people during these times, but films were especially a huge and popular form. Films gave people the chance to ignore current affairs, even if the films took place during the war. Films gave people hope, thinking that if the films have a happy ending then maybe they and their families and friends will all be okay.

### United Services Organization
The United Services Organization consisted of many different organizations but allowed many celebrities to travel and entertain troops. The USO traveled far and wide during World War II. One known figure was Bob Hope, who was mentioned by Christine in one of her letters. She addressed how he was leaving the base, which he was popular on. So, USO entertainment was popular on one side of the family.

![image of letter from Christine talking about seeing Bob Hope returning home from a USO tour](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19440309-smith-christine-bob-hope.png?raw=true)
Letter from Christine Smith to Martha Smith, March 9, 1944

On the other hand, USOs abroad did the same thing as they did in the states: entertain troops and keep the morale high during the war. As Christine was excited about the USO entertainment, Sonny Boy had a different response to the entertainment. He stated, "I didn't enjoy it much." Based on the horrible singing, he was not much of a fan. 
![Sonny Boy's letter describing his review of USO entertainment pt. 1 & pt. 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19431019-smith-sonnyboy.png)

Regardless, the USO brought entertainment to the troops free of charge and risked their well-being to do so. It was described as "a juggernaut mightier than any enemy" by Erin Blakemore. Blakemore continued to explain in her article the effect the stars and crew had from traveling and putting on shows for the frontline troops.
([USO at 75: The Surprising Fear That Created the USO](https://time.com/4205222/uso-75-years/))
The women who worked for the USO as hostesses did not always have as nice of an experience. Bettelee Zahn, who worked with the USO clubs,  “believed that the parents of some of the men who came to the club did not teach them to treat women “with great respect”” [*Good Girls Good Food Good Fun* p.94](<https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:2062907/one?qu=good+girls+good+food>). When it came to actually dating servicemen, USO hostesses were not allowed and even casual dating meant penalties or removal from the USO. That does not mean dating did not happen, however!.

## Women’s Social Lives: 
The Smith daughters were not the only women dating and marrying during this time. Several women, in the USA and from other countries, were marrying men from the army. Why did so many young people marry? Even before the war, society ingrained that marriages should happen young and “If girls were to marry at eighteen and boys at twenty, the preparation for marriage had to begin earlier than before” [(*From Front Porch to Back Seat: A History of the Date* p.25)](https://login.libprxy.muw.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edsjsr&AN=edsjsr.25163698&site=eds-live&scope=site). 

It is no surprise that the girls would date around, whether for fun or with the intent on marriage. Dating can also be considered a form of entertainment or escapism. Christine and Martha and Bernice were in their 20s during these years, and discussed with each other dozens of dates that they went on. Within the collection, there are several letters from some of these dates, which are often flirtatious and shows how a suitor might talk to a young lady.

<!--sentiment analysis and example letter from suitor-->

Plenty of young people had marriage on their mind, so Christine and Woody were one of many, many couples that wed during these few years! With so much dating around, it is no surprise that Christine would choose a man that would end up being her husband.

## Letters from the Front Lines

![Portrait of Sonny Boy after completing basic training in 1943](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/mcj-photograph-EMPS-11-006.jpg?raw=true)

### Psychological Effects:
There are many psychological effects of the war in general. However, during this period, it was uncommon to discuss these things. It was understood to never show them at all, especially for men. War is cruel and gruesome. Sonny Boy often leaves out or glosses over these details. Every now and then he shares experiences like this one from basic training: "If we didn't move fast enough there was a man behind us with a rifle and his ammunition shooting at our heels." (Letter from Sonny Boy to Christine Smith; September 7, 1943). 
![image of Sonny Boy's letter](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19430907-smith-sonnyboy-2.png?raw=true)

We don’t see the psychological effects that he experienced, such as: did he ever have PTSD or any other impact of the war? As stated in an article by Resul Cesur, Joseph J. Sabia, and Erdal Tekin in their paper series, ["The Psychological Costs of War: Military Combat and Mental Health](https://www.nber.org/papers/w16927)," they state, “We find that active-duty U.S. soldiers serving in combat zones are at greater risk of PTSD and are more likely to receive psychological or emotional counseling than their active- duty counterparts serving outside the United States in non-combat zones. In an N-Gram analysis of Sonny  Boy's Letters, there is some sense of affirming language to show that maybe his mental health was good during the war; however, there is still a possibility of him hiding such troubles, since words like good, love, and like are most prevalent. This N-Gram analysis was a part of the text analysis with multiple [cleaning configurations](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17281YIBXqMPi7Z-3q1jmnTVMIjECUsXNLz1jozV5_q4/edit).

![image of text analysis run with Voyant](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/sb-ngram-2023.png?raw=true)

Overall, showing the possibility of psychological effects of Sonny Boy can be difficult or not done at all since there is no evidence of it in Sonny Boy’s letters. For further research on masculinity during World War II consult the readings below.

### Censorship:
Another possible reason for omissions of content in Sonny Boy’s letters is the pretense of censors. Censoring communications of soldiers and their families was common during World War Two and was further investigated by Alvin William McDaniel Jr. in "The war on words: the Office of Censorship in World War II." McDaniel Jr. states, “On December 18, 1941, Congress passed the First War Powers Act which gave the President the power to conduct the censorship of all “...mail, cable, radio, or other means of transmission…” In some letters, Sonny Boy says he cannot share certain information about his location because of censors, and many of his letters contain censorship stamps.  

![image of censorship stamp on letter](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-mcj-dp018-19440429-sonnyboy-censorship-stamp.png?raw=true)

These offices would limit what any soldier could say to support the cause backing up United States affiliation in the war. Censorship played a significant role in the war and will eventually affect the letters, mainly blacking out lines. In running a sentiment analysis of the letters, hypothesizing a negative score in letters away from family during war, the letters from Sonny Boy and Robert Young remained mostly neutral-to-positive.
