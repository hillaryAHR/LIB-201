# Pittsboro...and beyond!

William Faulkner is famously quoted as saying, 
> "To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi." 

Many people, ourselves included, have a lot of assumptions about the rural communities that make up most of the state of Mississippi. This project peeks behind the curtain of some of these assumptions, using the letters of a white, Mississippi family who wrote to each other constantly. These letters, "The Smith Papers," rooted in Pittsboro Mississippi between 1929 and 1949, show the nuances of a richer tapestry than many people give credit, and by showing the threads of this fabric - the beautiful ones and the ugly ones - we hope to understand a place like Pittsboro, and in turn, part of the world.

This project explores the lives of a Southern white family through three themes:

1. [Wartime Correspondence](##a-network-of-wartime-correspondence)
2. [Domestic Lives of Women in Pittsboro](##domestic-lives-of-women-in-pittsboro)
3. [Race Relations in Pittsboro](##race-relations-in-pittsboro)

**Disclaimer**: This project contains discussion of offensive and harmful language to specific groups, particularly minority ethnic groups in the United States. The use of this language does not reflect the beliefs of the researchers. While we acknowledge the potential of this language to harm, we also want to maintain the historical authenticity of the documents enclosed, and hope that future researchers can learn about the origins of white racism from the language used here. 

## A Network of Correspondence
<!--This is where AMELIA will tie in your subtopic 1 to the main idea-->
The community of Pittsboro is a tight-knit rural community in Mississippi; the place which the Smith family calls *home*. Through the family's letters, we can learn about the menagerie of characters who inhabit this town and catch a glimpse of insight into their lifestyles. The unique closeness of this town's inhabitants fosters strong relationships that are unaffected by distance. Even if the Smiths are far away in foreign lands, they never fail to inquire about what's happening back home in Pittsboro.

As of today, Pittsboro is a town with a land area of 0.99 square miles and a population of only 157 people (citydata.com).<!--this needs to be either linked to the cite or referenced in the bibliography--> These statistics are not too far off from the makeup of the town during the time when the Smith family lived there. Always a small community, Pittsboro was a place where everybody knew everybody, and we can see this in the correspondence of the Smiths.

<!--placeholder for map of Pittsboro-->

For example, in a letter from Pauline to her two daughters, Christine and Martha, Pauline writes to the girls (currently at MSCW) about all of the happenings in Pittsboro. We learn about things like Mr. Sherman's new housekeeper, Less and Lois's separation, and Gilbert Goar being too drunk to show up in front of the judge (Smith, Edith Pauline, 1936). <!--need an image for this letter--> These types of conversations happen frequently within letters, as oftentimes Pauline is the one who remains home in Pittsboro while the rest of the family is off residing in various corners of the world.

Pauline is a core member of the Pittsboro community, and she is responsible for writing the majority of the letters within the Smith Family collection. From just a sample of 443 letters (which barely scratches the surface of the collection itself)<!--dates?-->, we can see that Pauline's web of connection is greater and more interconnected than any of her other family members. To explore this occurence, our class took note of senders and recipients of this sample of letters, used Google Sheets and a program called Palladio to create a network visualizing the people within the correspondences. Below is the resulting Network Analysis, where we can see that Pauline is the most central and largest node of the network. The shaded circle indicates Pauline's role as a sender, and each edge which emerges from that circle is a letter that she has sent to someone. The nodes represent residents of Pittsboro, connections abroad, and family members near and far, which shows Pauline's role as a great communicator and pillar of her community.

Of course, not all of the letters in the collection are from Pittsboro. The Smith family members have written from various corners of not just the United States, but from other countries as well. Dur in large part to World War II, Smith family members wrote from places ranging from Memphis, Tennessee, Saratoga Springs, New York, and even Panama. Sam "Sonny boy" Smith sent letters from foreign locations like France and Luxembourg during his wartime service during World War II. From just one mother living in the tiny town of Pittsboro, Mississippi, letters were sent all around the world.

Below is a sample of locations within the United States that have been sent to and from Smith family members. With this image we can see the massive range of locations touched by these letters in just the spand of a couple years.

## Domestic Lives of Women in Pittsboro
<!--This is where ALY will tie in your subtopic 2 to the main idea-->
The women within the Smith family, while all being raised in the same rural environment, demonstrated both conformity to and resistance of traditional gender norms in the 20th century. The matriarch of the family, Pauline Smith, took the traditional route expected of her generation by marrying young and staying in Pittsboro, MS, where she raised a family and remained the central hub for her children after they had moved away. While Pauline did not receive more than a high school education, she was very intelligent and loved to learn, keeping her textbooks and learning new trades as she aged (Conversation with Dr. Bridget Pieschel, November 16, 2024). Further examples of this can be seen in her quality and quantity of writing in the many letters she sent to her children that were full of details about her and others' lives both inside and out of Pittsboro. While Pauline did not have a job outside of the home, she still found ways to help the family financially. Most commonly, Pauline would utilize her sewing skills and either sell the clothing she made, or she would trade something like a dress for help doing laundry or other housework. The money she made through doing this and similar work would go towards things such as paying the taxes on her home.

Here is a timline that was made in our course that dives deeper into the topic of sewing and how it was used in the Smith Family:

[![Sewing Timeline](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/sewing-timeline.png)](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1JiWyoF-zOMfZM55ObK8vIdYtxRmzxOuH0yjqIC3CQgM&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

Within the next generation of Smith-family women, roles began to look slightly different than they had as Pauline's three girls - Bernice, Christine, and Martha - entered adulthood. While they all were given the same upbringing in Pittboro, they had opportunities that their mother did not, such as graduating from Mississippi State College for Women (now known as Mississippi University for Women). 

Bernice, after graduation, became a school teacher for a short time, and later became involved in clerical work in both Tennessee and Florida. This work allowed her to be self-supporting, making marriage an option rather than a necessity. Perhaps for this reason, or others unrelated, Bernice remained unmarried throughout her life, and was happy to do so (Conversation, November 16, 2024). Unlike the other sisters, Bernice eventually went back to Pittsboro where she stayed until her passing.

Christine, taking a more traditional route, married Woody Faust, a navy lieutenant, and became a military wife. She did, however, work in three different states, where she was able to support herself until her marriage. As a military spouse, she was given the opportunity to travel the world with her husband and gain a different perspective on life, where she was raised, and the world around her. While she was given the chance to travel most of her life, she still assumed the traditional position of homemaker with every move she and her husband made. Examples of this can be seen in letters to her mother discussing new household appliances that she has been getting used to. These letters are featured and discussed in a timeline that looks at household appliances in the early 20th century in relation to the Smith Family Women.

[![Household Appliance Timeline](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/appliances-timeline.png)](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1PTZMhHBsxN0BphCQpLCiKn85OyluZE4CQpg3MRphjj4&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

Another timeline, like the ones on sewing and applicance, looks at another topic related to the domestic sphere; the cost of groceries during WWII, which Christine and Pauline often discussed, since they were the ones who purchased groceries for their families. The timeline can be accessed here:
[![Groceries Timeline](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/groceries-timeline.png)](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1Xeq1X3P7toQC1SOoFFGpoElj3iWatA9ZBXAkfuTqVfo&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

Lastly, Martha graduated with a degree in Home Economics, which she used to teach as well as become a nutritionist. Like her older sisters, she too left Pittsboro and worked to support herself until she married Jim Womble and had a child that she raised in Florida.

While none of the sisters' lives in the Smith Family looked quite the same, they all pushed the boundaries of their small-town upbringing and lifestyle by pursuing higher education, maintaining careers, and traveling outside of Mississippi. They were still women of their time by the roles they played within their families as homemakers, mothers, teachers, etc., but they also were well-educated, working women, who decided their futures themselves and did not let societal expectations dictate their lives.

## Race relations in Pittsboro
<!--This is where JESS will tie in your subtopic 3 to the main idea--> Though racism was prevalent in the town of Pittsboro, Mississippi, a town that systemically supported the white supremacy of Theodore Bilbo, the Smith family was still moderately close with most of the families in town, regardless of race. They attended each others' funerals, and worked alongside them doing laundry, sewing, cooking, repair-work, and gardening (Conversation with Bridget Pieschel, Nov 16, 2024). However, the underlying current of racial hierarchies in Pittsboro was in conflict with people living their everyday lives.

The Smith Family in Pittsboro both fit and broke the mold of assumptions about people living in a small town in Mississippi - on the one hand, they perpetuated stereotypes of people of color through descriptions of and language toward them. On the other hand, the smallness of Pittsboro meant that they knew, lived with, worked with, and even cared for their neighbors who were black.

![Screenshot of Pauline's letter snippet about work](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/from-19431213-pauline.png)

<!--Screenshot of Pauline's letter snippet about work, needs to be uploaded to github https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Mq3jXhH0rTwWjhUfhbMPtgf16Bw6TsP/view?usp=drive_link-->

The racism they learned in Pittsboro experienced cracks in the veneer. When the Smith children - Bernice, Christine, Martha, and Sonny Boy - left Pittsboro for new experiences, they gained said new experiences. Christine, in one of her letters, writes to her mother about her life in Panama in 1947, writing, “Mixed throughout the crowd are people varying in color from light tan to black. Before you become unduly shocked, remember that this country belongs to these people, and we are the invaders. I have almost become accustomed to being waited on by polite, clean-looking negroes behind the counters.” In other words, Christine challenges her and her mother's idea that the idea that people of color are, as a group, in a lower caste. She distinguishes them from how she had viewed them in other places and in her past.

During the semester, we students had chosen several letters containing racial language to put into an Ngram analysis. The Ngram is a tool that determines the frequency of a word or word pairing in letters, in this case being the language of a racial nature or context. The Ngram puts the results into a wordcloud, with the most common phrases being the largest words.

![Ngram wordcloud](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/ngrams-wordcloud-screenshot.png)

In this picture, one can see that the largest phrase was the name Sonny Boy, which is understandable given the amount of letters he had written. The second largest phrase being used is “the japs,” and it is a subtle example of the authors of the letters using language to “other” a group from their (The Smiths) own white American identity. By othering the groups of people (in this case Japanese soldiers and citizens, enemies of the United States during World War II), they eliminated any trace of individuality or personhood and that allows for great generalizations to be accepted as truths.

![Ngram frequency](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201/blob/main/narrative-images/ngrams-screenshot-20241203.png)

This is a different way the Ngram analysis is shown, the results of which are in a graph format rather than a wordcloud. The analysis of these letters were inspired by Jane Hill's article *The Everyday Language of White Racism,* which discusses how the language of white racism uses implicit references to race (in addition to explicit) to code representations of other races. While we were unable to connect the ideas of implicit language to our ngram analysis directly, we were still able to identify patterns of language in the letters.

As noted during the interview with Dr. Bridget Pieschel, the daughters all seemed to evolve and grow from their original thoughts and feelings about race over the course of their lives outside of Pittsboro (Conversation with Dr. Bridget Pieschel, Nov 16, 2024). Being able to experience life outside of their small hometown allowed them to see that their expectations and inital understandings of people of other races were founded in wrongful beliefs and racist tendencies. While being a product of their environment and time period is not an excuse of the uses of racist language and stereotyping, it is an explaination. And it is a point of which the women grew from as time went on.

## About the Project
<!--give more context about the project you're writing. Think of it as a thesis statement for a paper-->
The Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Collection, housed at the Mississippi University for Women in Columbus, Mississippi, is a collection of letters ranging from 1908-1977 (with letters between 1929 to 1949 currently digitized) starting in Pittsboro, Mississippi, the hometown of the Smith family.

In our course, LIB 201, we used the Smith Collection as a medium to analyze the typical way of life in rural Mississippi. Using programs like Google Sheets, Palladio, TimelineJS, and other tools, we created metadata and charts representing information found within the letters. We then analyzed this information in various ways to find what we could about practices, beliefs, and attitudes held by the family. We hope that the information we extract from our created metadata can represent a portion of how rural Mississippians perceived the world in the early to mid 20th century, and perhaps our findings can be applied elsewhere to help researchers learn more about this period in Mississippi, and United States history.

More information about the Smith family and the Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen -Smith Collection can be found at https://athenacommons.muw.edu/smithpapers/ or by contacting an archvist at the Mississippi University for Women.
