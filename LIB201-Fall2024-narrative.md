# Pittsboro...and beyond!

William Faulkner is famously quoted as saying, 
> "To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi." 

Many people, ourselves included, have a lot of assumptions about the rural communities that make up most of the state of Mississippi. This project peeks behind the curtain of some of these assumptions, using the letters of a white, Mississippi family who wrote to each other constantly. These letters, "The Smith Papers," rooted in Pittsboro Mississippi between 1929 and 1949, show the nuances of a richer tapestry than many people give credit, and by showing the threads of this fabric - the beautiful ones and the ugly ones - we hope to understand a place like Pittsboro, and in turn, part of the world.

This project explores the lives of a Southern white family through three themes:

1. [Wartime Correspondence](#a-network-of-wartime-correspondence)
2. [Domestic Lives of Women in Pittsboro](#domestic-lives-of-women-in-pittsboro)
3. [Race Relations in Pittsboro](#race-relations-in-pittsboro)

## A Network of Wartime Correspondence
<!--This is where AMELIA will tie in your subtopic 1 to the main idea-->
The community of Pittsboro is a tight-knit rural community in Mississippi, and the place which the Smith family calls *home*. Despite its small size, through the family's letters we can learn about the menagerie of characters who inhabit this town and catch a glimpse of insight into their lifestyles. The unique closeness of this town's inhabitants fosters strong relationships that are unaffected by distance. Even if the Smiths are far away in foreign lands, they never fail to inquire about what's happening back home in Pittsboro.

*Talk about the different types of characters we learn about through the letters and what local attitudes we can surmise through them.*

## Domestic Lives of Women in Pittsboro
<!--This is where ALY will tie in your subtopic 2 to the main idea-->
TThe women within the Smith family, while all being raised in the same rural environment, demonstrated both conformity and push-back from traditional gender norms in the 20th century. The matriarch of the family, Pauline Smith, took the traditional route expected of her generation by marrying young and staying in Pittsboro, MS where she raised a family and remained the central hub for her children after they had moved away. While Pauline did not receive more than a high school education, she was very intelligent and loved to learn (Conversation with Dr. Bridget Pieschel, November 16, 2024). Examples of this can be seen in her quality and quantity of writing in the many letters she sent to her children that were full of details about her and others' lives both inside and out of Pittsboro. 

<!--let's break up all of this text somehow. Since you talk about Pauline most in the 1st paragraph, it might be a good idea to bring up how she also was economically savvy, using sewing as a cottage industry to pay taxes on her home-->

However, within the next generation of Smith-family women, roles began to look slightly different than they had as Pauline's three girls - Bernice, Christine, and Martha - entered adulthood. While they all were given the same upbringing in Pittboro, they had opportunities that their mother did not, such as graduating from Mississippi State College for Women (now known as Mississippi University for Women). 

Bernice, after graduation, became a school teacher for a short time, and later became involved in clerical work in both Tennessee and Florida. This work allowed her to be self-supporting, making marriage an option rather than a necessity for her. Perhaps for this reason, or others unrelated, Bernice remained unmarried throughout her life and was happy to do so (Conversation, November 16, 2024). Unlike the other sisters, Bernice eventually went back to Pittsboro where she stayed until her passing. <!--perhaps a photo of Bernice? See the photos folder in the smith-collection folder-->

Christine, taking a more traditional route, did get married. She married Woody Faust and became a military wife. She did, however, still work in three different states where she was able to support herself until her marriage. As a military spouse, she was given the opportunity to travel the world with her husband and gain a different perspective on life, where she was raised, and the world around her. <!--this could be a great place to introduce how even though she traveled the world, her domestic sphere followed her, as evidenced by her intrigue in modern appliances, and the timeline that you made-->

Lastly, Martha graduated with a degree in Home Economics which she used to teach as well as become a nutritionist. Like her older sisters, she too left Pittsboro and worked to support herself until she married James Womble and had a child that she raised in Flordia. <!--photo of martha?-->

While none of the sisters' lives in the Smith Family looked quite the same, they all pushed the boundaries of their small-town upbringing and lifestyle by pursuing higher education, maintaining careers, and traveling outside of Mississippi. Some married and had children, while others did not, and some chose not to move back to Pittsboro, instead creating a new home of their own. They were still women of their time by the roles they played within their families as homemakers, but they also were well-educated, working women, who decided their futures themselves and did not let societal expectations dictate

## Race relations in Pittsboro
<!--This is where JESS will tie in your subtopic 3 to the main idea--> Racism was still prevalent in the town of Pittsboro while the Smith family grew up. Despite that, the Smith family was still moderately close with most of the families in town, regardless of race. They attended each others funerals when the times came, worked alongside them doing whatever jobs were needing to be done at the time, laundry, sewing, cooking, repair-work, the like. There was still the underlying current of racial hierarchy in Pittsboro, but at the end of the day people were just trying to live their lives.
