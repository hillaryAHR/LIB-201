# Pittsboro...and beyond!

William Faulkner is famously quoted as saying, 
> "To understand the world, you must first understand a place like Mississippi." 

Many people, ourselves included, have a lot of assumptions about the rural communities that make up most of the state of Mississippi. This project peeks behind the curtain of some of these assumptions, using the letters of a white, Mississippi family who wrote to each other constantly. These letters, "The Smith Papers," rooted in Pittsboro Mississippi between 1929 and 1949, show the nuances of a richer tapestry than many people give credit, and by showing the threads of this fabric - the beautiful ones and the ugly ones - we hope to understand a place like Pittsboro, and in turn, part of the world.

## Pittsboro: A Network
<!--This is where AMELIA will tie in your subtopic 1 to the main idea-->
The community of Pittsboro is a tight-knight rural community in Mississippi, and the place which the Smith family calls *home*. Despite its small size, through the family's letters we can learn about the menagerie of characters who inhabit this town and catch a glimpse of insight into their lifestyles. The unique closeness of this town's inhabitants fosters strong relationships that are unaffected by distance. Even if the Smiths are far away in foreign lands, they never fail to inquire about what's happening back home in Pittsboro.

*Talk about the different types of characters we learn about through the letters and what local attitudes we can surmise through them.*

## Women in Pittsboro
<!--This is where ALY will tie in your subtopic 2 to the main idea-->
The women within the Smith family, while all being raised in the same rural environment, demonstrated both conformity and push-back from traditional gender norms in the 20th century. The matriarch of the family, Pauline Smith, took the traditional route expected of her generation by marrying young and staying in Pittsboro, MS where she raised a family and remained the central hub for her children after they had moved away. While Pauline did not receive more than a high school education, she was very intelligent and loved to learn. Examples of this can be seen in her quality as well of quantity of writing in the many letters she sent to her children that were full of details about hers and others lives both inside and out of Pittsboro.

## Pittsboro natives' views on race
<!--This is where JESS will tie in your subtopic 3 to the main idea--> Racism was still prevalent in the town of Pittsboro while the Smith family grew up. Despite that, the Smith family was still moderately close with most of the families in town, regardless of race. They attended each others funerals when the times came, worked alongside them doing whatever jobs were needing to be done at the time, laundry, sewing, cooking, repair-work, the like. There was still the underlying current of racial hierarchy in Pittsboro, but at the end of the day people were just trying to live their lives.
