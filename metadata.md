# Metadata: What and Why

As you transcribe, tag, and create information (or data!) about the letters in the Smith Papers Collection, you are essentially creating descriptive _metadata_. Metadata is just "data about data," and it's something archives uses to describe, preserve, organize, and digitize its contents <!--link to https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/metadata.html-->. In other words, Metadata makes items in a collection easy to find and discover.

Metadata makes the internet work! And for this class, it is one of the building blocks of digital research. Think about the items in a library database <!--insert screenshot-->. When you search for something with combinations of keywords, filters, search facets, etc., you are tapping the metadata that someone created. This applies to most things in a collection of digital things.

Think about the following digital items, and imagine what kinds of metadata you might interact with.

<!--html of website-->

Think also about what kinds of data and metadata had to be collected to create the following digital items:
<!--omeka website-->
<!--image of website of videos-->

<!--assessment that includes image of a letter and some multiple choice about what metadata could be derived from it. Choices (all of which are possible answers): date, creator, item type, description, record created by, date digitized-->

# Metadata Standards

Similar to citation guidelines (e.g. MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.), digital items use a schema to organize and standardize their formatting. For instance, websites use HTML and CSS to communicate things to browsers, library databases use specific fields to link similar online articles to each other, and so on. 

For the Smith Papers collection, we are using a common metadata standard/schema called _Dublin Core_. Dublin Core takes its name from Dublin, OH where it was created. Itâ€™s used by many libraries and cultural heritage institutions to describe both digital and physical objects. In doing this, we: 
* give the collection structure
* link it to similar items
* provide consistency across items within the collection

In other words, our metadata standards give guidelines for how to treat the 100+ ways to describe something! Think about the different ways you could write your own name, let alone someone else's you haven't met!

Open our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> guidelines for the Smith Collection</a> in another tab, and look at the different field names in the column headings. This is where the magic happens!

# Metadata Guidelines for the Smith Papers

As you noticed in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> guidelines for the Smith Collection</a>, we have a BUNCH of fields to describe one letter:

<!--make this a table later, or color code so it will correspond to sections following-->
* Identifier
* Title
* Description
* Creator
* Date
* Time Period
* Subject
* Mississippi County
* Geographic Location
* Resource Type
* Format
* Publisher
* Notes
* Rights
* Collection
* Source
* Digital Repository
* Date Digital
* Capture Method
* Master Image
* Record created by
* File name

What do all of these mean? Some of these items capture unique information about the specific letter:
* Identifier 
* Title
* Description
* Creator
* Date
<hr>

* Notes
* File name

Some of them capture information that link them to other items in the collection (and potentially outside the collection):
* Time Period
* Subject
* Mississippi County
* Geographic Location
* Resource Type
* Format
* Publisher

And lastly, some of them capture information about the digitization process, in the event that the digital record disappears:
* Digital Repository
* Date Digital
* Capture Method
* Master Image
* Record created by

Some of these fields are consistent, and will say one thing, or be one one of a few options (e.g. Capture Method, Digital Repository, Resource Type, etc.). And some will require your discretion (e.g. Description, Subject Heading, etc.)

Using the following letter and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> full guidelines </a>, enter the metadata you'd create for the following fields:

* Object Identifier
* Title 
* Description
<!--add more of these-->

<!--screenshot or link to letter...which one?-->
<!--include "right" answers-->

# Subject Headings

You'll notice there are a lot of ways we describe each letter. Whew! So why subject headings? Subject Headings are "controlled vocabulary," meaning you can group things together by category, so they'll be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Linked_Data_Service"> linked</a> by topic. For instance, if I used the subject heading "Dating (Social Customs)" -- and we do! -- all of the letters with that designation can be grouped together.

There are a number of <a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html"> determined subject headings</a> defined by the Library of Congress, but how do we decide which subject heading to use on our own?
