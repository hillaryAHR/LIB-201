# Introduction to Metadata

Metadata are the building blocks of digital scholarship! We will be creating, structuring, and using metadata throughout this course to participate in digital research and learn more about our collection. In this lesson, you will:
- Understand what metadata are, and why they're important
- Understand the importance of consistency in metadata through metadata standards
- Interact with a set of metadata standards
- Locate and choose Library of Congress Subject Headings as a type of metadata
- Create your own metadata for items in the Smith Papers Collection

## Ethical considerations
People create metadata, and people usually have biases, implicit or explicit. Metadata and metadata standards have been created by people with a notably white, Western standard. For example, for many years, the Library of Congress classified books on homosexuality under “sexual deviance.” Actually, an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College began a campaign to change the “illegal alien” subject heading to “noncitizen.” <!--link to actual story, plus the article about redo-ing cutter numbers, plus example from Vic re: "minorities"-->

# 1. Metadata-What and Why

As you transcribe, tag, and create information (or data!) about the letters in the Smith Papers Collection, you are essentially creating descriptive _metadata_. Metadata is just "data about data," and it's something <a href="https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/metadata.html">archivists use</a> to describe, preserve, organize, and digitize its contents. In other words, Metadata makes items in a collection easy to find and discover.

Metadata makes the internet work! And for this class, it is one of the building blocks of digital research. Think about the items in a library database <!--insert screenshot and link https://login.libprxy.muw.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&bquery=pizza&cli0=RV&clv0=Y&type=1&searchMode=And&site=eds-live&scope=site-->. 

When you search for something with combinations of keywords, filters, search facets, etc., you are tapping the metadata that someone created. This applies to most things in a collection of digital things.

Think about the following digital items, and imagine what kinds of metadata you might interact with.

Think also about what kinds of data and metadata had to be collected to create the following digital items:
<!--omeka website-->
<!--image of website of videos-->

<!--assessment that includes image of a letter and some multiple choice about what metadata could be derived from it. Choices (all of which are possible answers): date, creator, item type, description, record created by, date digitized-->

# 2. Metadata Standards

Similar to citation guidelines (e.g. MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.), digital items use a schema to organize and standardize their formatting. For instance, websites use HTML and CSS to communicate things to browsers, library databases use specific fields to link similar online articles to each other, and so on. 

For the Smith Papers collection, we are using a common metadata standard/schema called _Dublin Core_. Dublin Core takes its name from Dublin, OH where it was created. It’s used by many libraries and cultural heritage institutions to describe both digital and physical objects. In doing this, we: 
* give the collection structure
* link it to similar items
* provide consistency across items within the collection

In other words, our metadata standards give guidelines for how to treat the 100+ ways to describe something! Think about the different ways you could write your own name, let alone someone else's you haven't met!

Open our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> guidelines for the Smith Collection</a> in another tab, and look at the different field names in the column headings. This is where the magic happens!

# 3. Metadata Guidelines for the Smith Papers

As you noticed in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> guidelines for the Smith Collection</a>, we have a BUNCH of fields to describe one letter:

<!--make this a table later, or color code so it will correspond to sections following-->
* Identifier
* Title
* Description
* Creator
* Date
* Time Period
* Subject
* Mississippi County
* Geographic Location
* Resource Type
* Format
* Publisher
* Notes
* Rights
* Collection
* Source
* Digital Repository
* Date Digital
* Capture Method
* Master Image
* Record created by
* File name

What do all of these mean? Some of these items capture unique information about the specific letter:
* Identifier 
* Title
* Description
* Creator
* Date
<hr>

* Notes
* File name

Some of them capture information that link them to other items in the collection (and potentially outside the collection):
* Time Period
* Subject
* Mississippi County
* Geographic Location
* Resource Type
* Format
* Publisher

And lastly, some of them capture information about the digitization process, in the event that the digital record disappears:
* Digital Repository
* Date Digital
* Capture Method
* Master Image
* Record created by

Some of these fields are consistent, and will say one thing, or be one one of a few options (e.g. Capture Method, Digital Repository, Resource Type, etc.). And some will require your discretion (e.g. Description, Subject Heading, etc.)

Using the following letter and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VIQ4KxbBbFnjnrbgR-Uv1t1H0_xSgWG/view?usp=sharing"> full guidelines </a>, enter the metadata you'd create for the following fields:

* Object Identifier
* Title 
* Description
<!--add more of these-->

<!--include "right" answers-->

# 4. Library of Congress Subject Headings

You'll notice there are a lot of ways we describe each letter. Whew! So why subject headings? Subject Headings, like metadata standards, use "controlled vocabulary," meaning you can group things together by category, so they'll be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Linked_Data_Service"> linked</a> by topic. For instance, if I used the subject heading "Dating (Social Customs)" -- and we do! -- all of the letters with that designation can be grouped together.

There are a number of <a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html"> determined subject headings</a> defined by the Library of Congress, but how do we decide which subject heading to use on our own?

<!--How to look up subject headings: list + use catalog-->
<!--assessment - write down number of ways to describe a given topic, using catalog/list-->

Let's pause. Controlled vocabularies are great for consistency and linking things, but they can also be problematic, especially when it comes to describing historically marginalized people. Consider the subject heading <a href="https://mlp.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/muw/search/results?qu=Minorities.&lm=MUWITEMS&rt=false%7C%7C%7CSUBJECT%7C%7C%7CSubject">"minorities,"</a> which isn't very descriptive, and is often a loaded term, neither of which create a helpful category for users when interacting with items in a collection. If you came across a folder of photographs labeled "minorities," what would you expect to find? Even if you didn't know what was in there, what would be more specific, more helpful, or more appropriate?

# 5. Project and Data management
By this point, you have seen how much behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating metadata from scratch! It's a lot! And this is just when you're creating metadata on your own. We are working as a group! Let's discuss what we'll need to consider moving forward.

## Progress
How do you document your progress so someone could pick up where you leave off and won't duplicate your work?

<!--importance of documentation-->
<!--tools for project management - asana screenshot-->

## Communication - (sorry it doesn't start with a P)
How do you talk to each other outside of class time? How do you leave messages, and what are the expectations for responding?

<!--teams screenshot-->

External communication: how do you describe your project to people who aren't working on it? Elevator speech.

## Preservation
How do you save things so other people can access them?

<!--Drive screenshot-->

## Principles
What are some foundational practices that you adopt and value as a group? What are a few words that encompass how you'll collaborate together?
