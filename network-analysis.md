# Network Analysis
A Network Analysis is simply a study of relationships among a group of connected things. The "things" could be people, cities, cells in the body, etc.! The idea of a network analysis is to visualize these relationships, so you can see the patterns (or lack thereof) in connections within the network.

We use network analysis to ask questions about the players in the network, like 
* Who is the most/least influential?
* What are some of the roles of the different things in this network?
* How connected are the things in this network?
* Are there distinct subgroups or "neighborhoods" in this network?

For the Smith Papers collection, we are asking these questions, more or less! 

| Question | Smith Papers Translation |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Who is the most influential? | Which person wrote the most letters to the most people? |
| How connected is this network? | Did everyone write letters to each other, or just some people? |
| What are the distinct groups? | Who wrote to each other most often? |

# Network Analysis Terms
Most softwares that facilitate Network Analyses use a different vocabulary. You'll learn about what each part of a network is in this section, and in the next section, we'll talk about different ways analyze those parts.

## Networks

## Nodes
## Edges
* Undirected
* Directed
  * Source
  * Target
## Paths 
## Degree
## Centrality

# Analyzing relational data
Did that phrase make your stomach turn? Don't worry! We are not actually doing math in this class, but we will be using mathematic concepts. Let's break it down.
